<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This tutorial looks at resolving conflicts in <em>git</em>.</p>
<p>Conflicts arise when changes are made by different commits which
<em>git</em> cannot reconcile automatically. User intervention is
required to make sense of the intent of the changes by manually
reconciling changes.</p>

<div id="section-the-edit-leftrightarrow-commit-cycle."
class="section level2">
<h2>The edit <span class="math inline">\(\leftrightarrow\)</span> commit
cycle.</h2>
<p>Let's remind ourselves of the <em>git</em> edit cycle:</p>
<div class="centre">
<p><img src="images/collaborative_workflow.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>In this cycle it is possible that when we ask for an update
concerning changes other people have made independently of our changes
we might find that they have done something different to a section of a
file that we also changed. When this happens <em>git</em> will ask us to
fix it and then we will need to communicate the fix back to everyone
else.</p>
<div class="centre">
<p><img src="images/conflicts.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Fixing these conflicts <em>is just like any other edit
operation</em>: the aim is to leave the project in a consistent sensible
state.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-conflicts" class="section level2">
<h2>Conflicts</h2>
<p>When multiple copies of a project are worked on concurrently:</p>
<ul>
<li>by multiple users with their own copies</li>
<li>by a single user with multiple copies</li>
</ul>
<p>a situation can arise where <em>different</em> changes are made to
the <em>same</em> section of a file.</p>
<p>Generally, <em>git</em> can handle the following concurrent edit
scenarios:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>changes to different 'non-overlapping' sections of files</li>
<li>identical changes to the same section of a file</li>
<li>changes to one section of a file by one user where no change has
been made to that section by other users
<ul>
<li>this is really a special case of scenario (1)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="section-tracking-the-locations-of-change"
class="section level2">
<h2>Tracking the locations of change</h2>
<div id="section-an-aside..." class="section level3 aside">
<h3>An aside...</h3>
<p>We shall be discussing and examining example of conflicts in
<em>text</em> files which are tracked on a line-by-line basis by
<em>git</em>. Non-text files such as images or compressed file and so on
are not handled line-by-line when it comes to conflicts. <em>Git</em>
stores binary file and changes to those files in an efficient manner but
since it is hard to show changes to a binary file in a sensible way,
resolving conflicts on binary files is generally an all-or-nothing
affair: the entirety of one or the other of two conflicting versions (or
a completely new version) is chosen.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Git</em> tracks the location of changes, not by line number
(which can change when edits are made in prior sections of a file) but
by <em>context</em>.</p>
<p>You may have noticed when looking at <em>diffs</em> and logs of
commit changes that a few lines either side of a change are usually
presented along with the change. This is how <em>git</em> locates where
to apply a change to a file even when text within the file moves around.
Think of them as <em>anchor points</em> for the changes to be
applied.</p>
<p><em>Git</em> has trouble applying a change if:</p>
<ul>
<li>one or both of the anchor contexts have disappeared</li>
<li>two different changes have been made to the text between the start
and end contexts</li>
</ul>
<p>When this happens <em>git</em> will alert us to the <em>conflict</em>
and ask for it to be resolved.</p>
<p>In order for such conflicts to always be noticed, <em>git</em> does
not allow a <em>push</em> to a remote repository when the local
repository is out-of-date, <em>i.e.</em> when the remote repository has
'more changes in it' than the local repository. (That's a bit hand-wavy
but it will do for now.)</p>
<p>When this happens, <em>git</em> requires a <em>pull</em> be made
before the <em>push</em> can occur. When the <em>pull</em> is made,
conflicts will be detected and can (and must) be fixed. (If a
<em>push</em> were allowed to the remote repository, conflicts could
build up remotely and never get fixed; a user would one day do a
<em>pull</em> and find 100 conflicts waiting to be fixed!)</p>
</div>
<div id="section-identifying-conflicts" class="section level2">
<h2>Identifying conflicts</h2>
<p>Conflicts are indicated in the text using marker character
strings:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> marks the beginning of the
area that needs fixing</li>
<li><code>=======</code> separates the two different versions, and</li>
<li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> marks the end of the area
that needs fixing</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
my changes
=======
pulled changes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be2b0441bebfb70c6eef9827678bbb12f149bf4d</code></pre>
<p>The aim is to replace the entire section with the 'correct' version.
What is 'correct' is entirely up to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might decide your changes are better than the remote changes
you're pulling in so you delete the markers and the second chunk of
text</li>
<li>You might decide that the remote changes are better and your changes
are unwanted so you keep the second chunk and delete the first</li>
<li>You might need to incorporate changes from both, replacing the
entire section</li>
<li>You might come up with a completely new replacement that is nothing
like either of them</li>
<li>You might decide to delete both changes altogether</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no single right answer.</p>
<p>To resolve the conflict, <em>edit</em>, <em>add</em> and
<em>commit</em> as usual.</p>
<p>Note that there may be more than one set of conflicts in a file. Make
sure you get them all by searching for
<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> markers until none are
left.</p>
<p><span class="warning">It is very important not to just check the
check box when conflicts happen and blindly commit.</span></p>
<p>Neglecting to fix the conflicts will lead to the
<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>=======</code> and
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> markers and the different
versions of the text getting committed. This will in turn lead to more
conflicts down the track with nested marks and not-so-hilarious results.
Your colleagues will not thank you.</p>
<p>Because <em>git</em> keeps track of all the different versions,
nothing is irreparable if you do this, everything can be fixed as we
have a full history of all our files. Fixing a single
accidentally-committed conflict is relatively easy. Fixing nested
conflicts gets messy and confusing very fast so if you accidentally do
this, fix it as soon as possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-resolving-conflicts" class="section level2">
<h2>Resolving conflicts</h2>
<p>We're going to step through the process of resolving a conflict.</p>
<ul>
<li>One user is going to enter some text (<em>Clancy of the
Overflow</em>) omitting a few verses and <em>commit</em> it locally</li>
<li>This first user is going to <em>push</em> the result to a remote
repository</li>
<li>A second user is going to <em>clone</em> this project and add some
(but not all) of the verses and provide a verse which is not the
original text</li>
<li>The second user will <em>commit</em> these changes (locally) and
<em>push</em> the result back to the remote repository</li>
<li><em>Without pulling</em> the first user notices the missing verses
and adds them back in and <em>commits</em> them (locally)</li>
<li>The first user now tries to <em>push</em> and is told the local
repository is out-of-date</li>
<li>The first user <em>pulls</em> to get pending remote changes</li>
<li>At this point a conflict is discovered</li>
<li>The first user will fix the conflict, <em>commit</em> the changes
and <em>push</em> the reconciled version of the changes</li>
<li>At some later point the second user will <em>pull</em> and get the
reconciled version</li>
<li>Both users will then have the same changes (and history of changes)
in their repositories</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-user-1-a-new-project" class="section level2">
<h2>User 1: A new project</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this tutorial we will create a new project and
push it to <em>GitHub</em>.</p>
<p>There are several ways of working on a project under <em>git's</em>
control:</p>
<ul>
<li>clone an existing project on <em>GitHub</em> locally</li>
<li>create a new project on <em>GitHub</em> and then clone it
locally</li>
<li>bring an existing project under the control of <em>git</em> and push
it into an empty project on <em>GitHub</em></li>
<li>create a new empty project locally and push it into an empty project
on <em>GitHub</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We shall be doing the last, so we select <em>File &gt;&gt; New
Project...</em> from the menus in <em>RStudio</em>, choose <em>New
Directory</em> in the window that pops up, choose <em>New Project</em>
for the <em>Project Type</em>, and then fill in the location where we
want to create the project making sure we tick the <em>Create a git
repository</em> check box.</p>
<p>In the new project (which we have called <code>conflict</code>) we
create a new text file called <code>clancy.txt</code> and enter the text
of the poem <em>Clancy of the Overflow,</em> by Banjo Patterson.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better,<br />
Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the Lachlan, years ago,<br />
He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,<br />
Just on spec, addressed as follows, “Clancy, of The Overflow”.</p>
<p>And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,<br />
(And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)<br />
’Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim I will quote
it:<br />
“Clancy’s gone to Queensland droving, and we don’t know where he
are.”</p>
<p>In my wild erratic fancy visions come to me of Clancy<br />
Gone a-droving “down the Cooper” where the Western drovers go;<br />
As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them
singing,<br />
For the drover’s life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know.</p>
<p>And the bush hath friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet
him<br />
In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,<br />
And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,<br />
And at night the wond’rous glory of the everlasting stars.</p>
<p>I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy<br />
Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall,<br />
And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city<br />
Through the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all.</p>
<p>And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle<br />
Of the tramways and the buses making hurry down the street,<br />
And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,<br />
Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet.</p>
<p>And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt
me<br />
As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste,<br />
With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and
weedy,<br />
For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.</p>
<p>And I somehow rather fancy that I’d like to change with Clancy,<br />
Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,<br />
While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal
—<br />
But I doubt he'd suit the office, Clancy, of The Overflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>However,</em> we will leave out the second, fourth and sixth
verses.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/000_start.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>Notice at this point we have saved our new text file but we have not
added or committed any files to <em>git's</em> care (as shown by the
<code>?</code> in the <em>Status</em> column of the <em>git</em>
pane).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-user-1-the-initial-commit" class="section level2">
<h2>User 1: The initial commit</h2>
<p>Let's <em>commit</em> all the files of our new project, making sure
to tick the <em>Staged</em> box to <em>add</em> them.</p>
<p>Here is our project with a sensible <em>commit</em> message just
before we press the <em>Commit</em> button:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/010_initial_commit.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>And here it is just after, showing <em>git's</em> output as it
performs the <em>commit:</em></p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/011_initial_commit_result.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>It will be instructive to look at the <em>git</em> history of the
project at this point and see the state of the world as <em>git</em>
sees it locally:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/012_initial_commit_history.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>We have only made one <em>commit</em> and where we are working (the
green cartouche with <code>HEAD</code> in it) is at that commit,
<em>i.e.</em> we're working at the most up-to-date place <em>git</em>
can be.</p>
<div id="section-under-the-bonnet..."
class="section level3 under-the-bonnet">
<h3>Under the bonnet...</h3>
<p>We can see a lot of information in this pane:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is only one <em>commit</em> (<code>dec2beac</code>) so far
(because there is only one line)</li>
<li>in this <em>commit</em> we added a bunch of files</li>
<li>it was done on 16/8/2018 at 06:59 UTC by James Farrow</li>
<li>the <code>HEAD</code> (where we're working) is at the tip of the
<code>master</code> branch (the main line of development)</li>
<li>this <em>commit</em> according to the commit message was
<code>Initial commit. Clancy of the Overflow missing verses 2, 4 and 6.</code>
(this is why we choose sensible and descriptive commit messages).</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-user-1-pushing-upstream" class="section level2">
<h2>User 1: Pushing upstream</h2>
<p>So far with <em>git</em> we have been adding and committing files to
a <em>local repository.</em> A repository is a place where <em>git</em>
keeps all the information it knows about files and changes. The local
repository is kept in the <code>.git</code> directory in the top
directory/folder of our project. <span class="warning"><em>You should
never touch anything in this folder directly unless you know</em>
exactly <em>what you are doing.</em></span></p>
<p>We can have a <em>remote repository</em> which we can <em>push</em>
changes to and <em>pull</em> changes from. Conventionally this remote
repository is called the <code>origin</code> and is referred to as being
'upstream' from our local repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>we <em>push</em> changes upstream from our local repository to the
<code>origin</code></li>
<li>we <em>pull</em> changes from the <code>origin</code> to our local
repository</li>
</ul>
<p>The remote repository might have already been in existence (either
empty or with files in it) and we cloned it locally to begin work. This
process usually sets up our <code>master</code> branch to track changes
in the remote <code>origin/master</code> branch automatically,
<em>i.e.</em> when we <em>push</em> we push changes from our
<code>master</code> to the <code>master</code> branch of the
<code>origin</code> and when we <em>pull</em> we pull any changes we
don't have yet in our <code>master</code> from the <code>master</code>
branch of the <code>origin</code>.</p>
<div id="section-under-the-bonnet...-1"
class="section level3 under-the-bonnet">
<h3>Under the bonnet...</h3>
<p>A <em>pull</em> is actually two operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>fetch</em> from the branch on the <code>origin</code> server
to a local copy of that remote branch</li>
<li>a <em>merge</em> of the local copy of the remote branch to the local
working branch</li>
</ul>
<p>It's usually convenient to use <em>pull</em> to do these operations
together.</p>
</div>
<p>In our case we are going to take our existing local repository (the
one we have just created) and <em>push</em> it into an empty remote
repository on <em>GitHub.</em></p>
<p>First, let's create a new repository on <em>GitHub</em>. We're going
to call it <code>conflict</code> because we're going to use it to
demonstrate edit conflicts.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/020_push_create_repository.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p><em>GitHub</em> informs us of several ways we can populate our new
remote repository</p>
<ul>
<li>we can create a new (local) repository and associate it with the
remote repository</li>
<li>we can push an existing (local) repository to the remote
repository</li>
<li>we can import code from another kind of repository</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we already have a repository we're going to follow the second
suggestion.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/021_push_github_remote_info.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>We will associate the <em>GitHub</em> remote repository with our
local repository by setting it as the <code>origin</code> and then we
will push the local repository to the remote repository.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <em>RStudio</em> has no facilities for setting the
<code>origin</code> directly. It would do this for us if we open a new
project by cloning a project from <em>GitHub</em> but for our case we
will need to open a shell and issue a few <em>git</em> commands to
effect the setup.</p>
<p>To do this in <em>Rstudio</em> we'll use the drop-down menu accessed
<em>via</em> the cog icon in the <em>git</em> pane and select
<em>Shell....</em></p>
<p>Notice at this point in the <em>RStudio</em> UI the <em>push</em> and
<em>pull</em> icons (up and down arrows) on the <em>git</em> tab are
inactive. This is because at this point there is no upstream
<code>origin</code> repository associated with the local repository.
We're about to change that.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/022_push_pre_add_remote.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>We open the shell and run two commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>set the upstream <code>origin</code> to be the <em>GitHub</em>
repository</li>
<li><em>push</em> the local repository to the <code>origin</code></li>
</ul>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/023_push_add_remote_and_push.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>This has the side-effect of setting up our local <code>master</code>
branch to track the remote <code>origin/master</code> branch (which is
what we want).</p>
<p>Now the <em>push</em> and <em>pull</em> icons (up and down arrows) on
the <em>git</em> tab are active.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/024_push_post_add_remote_and_push.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>In our commit history we can see that we have a new piece of
information. Previously the commit history only had the status of our
local repository in it as we saw:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/012_initial_commit_history.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>Now, after adding an <code>origin</code> and performing our push we
have some new information in the history: information about the status
of the <code>origin</code> repository.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/025_push_post_push_history.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-an-aside...-1" class="section level3 aside">
<h3>An aside...</h3>
<p>It's important to draw the distinction that this is
<strong><em>not</em></strong> a statement about the current status of
the <code>origin</code> server. It is a statement about <em>the local
repository's knowledge of the origin server.</em> These two things can
be quite different as the local repository only updates its knowledge
about the remote <code>origin</code> on a successful <em>pull</em> or
<em>push</em>. Independent interaction with the <code>origin</code> by
other users may change the state of the <code>origin</code> and these
changes won't be known to the local repository until the next
<em>pull.</em></p>
</div>
<p>So, at this point, from this user's point-of-view, the local
repository and the remote repository are synchronised.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at <em>GitHub</em> just to check:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/026_push_post_push_github.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-user-2-starts-work" class="section level2">
<h2>User 2 starts work</h2>
<p>At this point, a second user comes along and wants to work on the
repository. This user, let's call him Guy Incognito, goes to
<em>GitHub</em> and retrieves the URL to clone the repository from the
repository page.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/030_clone_github.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>In <em>RStudio</em> he selects <em>File &gt;&gt; New Project...</em>
from the menu and undertakes to check out a new project from a version
control repository by selecting the <em>Version Control</em> option.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/031_clone_new_project.png"
style="width:50.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>He choose to clone from a <em>git</em> repository:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/032_clone_new_project_git.png"
style="width:50.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>and enters the information taken from the <em>GitHub</em> project
page to create the new project directory:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/033_clone_create_project.png"
style="width:50.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>Once this is complete, our new user, Guy, has an up-to-date copy of
the repository:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/034_clone_done.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>His local commit history lists shows our local <code>HEAD</code> (in
green) and his repository's idea of the <code>origin</code> repository
(grey).</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/035_clone_history.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>There is only one commit <code>dec2beac</code> and at this point
everyone has a copy of it.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-user-2-makes-some-changes" class="section level2">
<h2>User 2 makes some changes</h2>
<p>At this point, User 2 (Guy) decides to add in verse four and an
alternative version of verse six.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/040_edit_4_and_new_6.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>We see that Guy has saved his changes so the <em>git</em> pane shows
<code>clancy.txt</code> as being modified and needing to be
committed.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-user-2-commits-the-changes" class="section level2">
<h2>User 2 commits the changes</h2>
<p>Our second user, Guy, commits his changes:</p>

</div>
<p>In this window we can see he has chosen to stage his changes for
commit and that he has edited <code>clancy.txt</code> by adding two
verses (verse four and verse six) and has entered a suitably descriptive
commit message.</p>
<p>And so, he pushes the <em>Commit</em> button:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/051_commit_result.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>If you look carefully in the background, you can see a message which
says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ⓘ️ Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we look at the commit history we can see this:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/052_commit_history.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that as far as Guy knows, the <code>origin/master</code> still
only has one commit (<code>dec2beac</code>) and he has added a second
commit (<code>a5d202e4</code>) placing his <code>master</code> one
commit ahead of <code>origin/master</code>.</p>
<p>This means there are changes he knows about which the upstream server
doesn't. A <em>push</em> will push those changes to the remote
<code>origin</code> repository (<em>GitHub</em>).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-user-2-pushes" class="section level2">
<h2>User 2 pushes</h2>
<p>User 2 (Guy) has changes that are not in the upstream repository. His
<code>master</code> is one commit ahead of (has one commit that is not
in) the <code>origin/master</code>.</p>
<p>So he decides to <em>push:</em></p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/060_push_result.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>This pushes (shares) his changes with the remote <em>GitHub</em> copy
of the repository. Since the local repository now 'knows' the remote
repository has this information, it updates where it thinks
<code>origin/master</code> is up to:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/061_push_history.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>We can see that from Guy's point-of-view, his repository and the
remote repository are synchronised.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-user-1-some-more-edits" class="section level2">
<h2>User 1: some more edits</h2>
<p>At this point, if User 1 did a <em>pull</em>, all of User 2's changes
would be brought down locally, User 1 could make further edits and then
<em>push</em> back to the remote repository and there will have been no
conflict because all edits would be made sequentially: User 1 then User
2 then User 1 again.</p>
<p>However, if User 1 has not used <em>pull</em> to grab changes from
the remote repository there is no local knowledge of User 2's edits. In
essence User 1 has made the initial edits and now User 1 and User 2 are
making changes at the same time.</p>
<p>Let's see what happens.</p>
<p>User 1 realises that verses two, four and six were left out and adds
them:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/070_edit_246.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>This is all perfectly normal and User 1 saves the changes so the
<em>git</em> pane indicates <code>clancy.txt</code> has been
modified.</p>
<p>To continue User 1 will need to <em>commit</em> the changes.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-user-1-committing-new-changes" class="section level2">
<h2>User 1: committing new changes</h2>
<p>User 1 commits the new version of <code>clancy.txt</code>. This is
all local so there is no problem and no conflict.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/080_commit.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>We can see that verses two, four and six have been added and User 1
is being a good team player and entering a sensible commit message.</p>
<p>The <em>Commit</em> button is pressed. Nothing stops this and no
conflict is created because User 1 is only changing the local
repository.</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/081_commit_result.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>Let's have a look at User 1's commit history:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/082_commit_history.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>This makes sense. From User 1's point-of-view:</p>
<ul>
<li>the upstream repository only contains one commit
(<code>dec2beac</code>)
<ul>
<li>remember User 1 has not tried to <em>pull</em> or <em>push</em> yet
and so knows nothing about User 2's changes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the local repository has a new commit (<code>549760ee</code>) with
the new changes</li>
</ul>
<p>User 1 now wishes to share those new changes by using <em>push</em>
to send them upstream to the remote repository.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-user-1-a-push-attempt" class="section level2">
<h2>User 1: A push attempt</h2>
<p>User 1 has changes in the local repository which need to be shared so
a <em>push</em> is attempted:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/090_push_attempt.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p><span class="warning">This <em>push</em> has failed.</span></p>
<p>It's very easy to fall into the habit of always dismissing this box
which pops up after performing a <em>git</em> action. <strong>It's very
important to always check it for errors.</strong></p>
<p>We see the following text:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; git push origin refs/head/master
To https://github.com/jmfarrow/conflict.git
 ! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to &#39;https://github.com/jmfarrow/conflict.git&#39;
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., &#39;git pull ...&#39;) before pushing again.
hint: See the &#39;Note about fast-forwards&#39; in &#39;git push --help&#39; for details.</code></pre>
<p>Most of this should be fairly self-explanatory or at least
understandable with a little thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>git has tried to push our <code>master</code> to the
<code>origin</code></li>
<li>it failed</li>
<li>it failed because there is extra stuff at the <code>origin</code>
that we don't have</li>
<li>it suggests that it might be because someone else has contributed
changes (since we last updated)</li>
<li>it suggests we might want to pull down the remote changes and
incorporate them to continue</li>
</ul>
<p>So let's pull.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-user-1-pull" class="section level2">
<h2>User 1: Pull</h2>
<p>User 1's local repository is behind the remote repository. As a
result, <em>git</em> wants us to update by performing a <em>pull</em>
and integrating any changes we haven't yet seen before it will let us
<em>push</em> our outstanding changes.</p>
<p>Because we're about to merge upstream changes with local changes we
should <span class="warning">always make sure there is no outstanding
uncommitted work locally before running
<code>git pull</code>.</span></p>
<p>The easiest way to ensure this is to make sure we have performed a
<em>commit</em> and have committed everything before we <em>pull</em>
(<em>i.e.</em> there is nothing outstanding in the <em>git</em>
pane).</p>
<p>In our case we have just done this.</p>
<div id="section-under-the-bonnet...-2"
class="section level3 under-the-bonnet">
<h3>Under the bonnet...</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may not want to <em>commit</em> all your changes.</p>
<p>Without going into detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>you might create a new branch and put your changes there before
returning to this branch and merging</li>
<li>you might use <code>git stash</code> to save all pending changes and
<code>git stash pop</code> to get them back again after the merge</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't do either of these until you know what you're doing.</p>
</div>
<p>Let's <em>pull.</em></p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/100_pull.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>This didn't fail, but <span class="warning">it has warned us there is
a merge conflict.</span></p>
<p>A lot of the time, <em>git</em> can merge changes from other authors
into our repository without help.</p>
<p>When that is possible, the <em>pull</em> just merges in all the
changes and will <em>commit</em> the result for us. When we go back and
look at the commit history, we'd see something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/jmfarrow/conflict</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no conflict and we can just continue editing and committing
and pushing.</p>
<p>In this case however, <em>git</em> could not merge the changes (we'll
see why in a moment).</p>
<p>Let's look at the commit history after this <em>pull:</em></p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/101_pull_history.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that we've now pulled down the commit that User 2 made
(<code>a5d202e4</code>) and that's where we think <code>origin</code> is
at. So</p>
<ul>
<li>our <code>master</code> branch has our original work and our new
work (<code>dec2beac</code> and <code>549760ee</code>)</li>
<li>the <code>origin/master</code> branch has our original work and User
2's work (<code>dec2beac</code> and <code>a5d202e4</code>)</li>
<li>they have diverged and not merged yet (because <em>git</em> couldn't
automatically reconcile the differences)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look at the <em>Author</em> column you can see who made the
contributions.</p>
<p><em>Git</em> wants us to fix this situation.</p>
<div id="section-under-the-bonnet...-3"
class="section level3 under-the-bonnet">
<h3>Under the bonnet...</h3>
<p><em>Git</em> is actually in the middle of a <em>merge</em> at this
point.</p>
<p>It is waiting for us to fix everything and perform a
<em>commit</em>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if we get really stuck we can back out of the merge by
running</p>
<pre><code>git merge --abort</code></pre>
<p>on the command line.</p>
<p>Note that <code>git merge --help</code> says for
<code>--abort</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abort the current conflict resolution process, and try to reconstruct
the pre-merge state.</p>
<p>If there were uncommitted worktree changes present when the merge
started, git merge --abort will in some cases be unable to reconstruct
these changes.<br />
It is therefore recommended to always commit or stash your changes
before running git merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was mentioned above.</p>
<p>This only defers things: it leaves the fetched changes in the local
version of <code>origin/master</code> but returns <code>master</code> to
the pre-pull state. A merge will still have to occur by running
<code>git merge origin</code> at a later point.</p>
<p>There is no facility for doing any of this in <em>RStudio</em>, it
all needs to be done on the command line.</p>
<p>It's probably better to just sort out the merge and commit as shown
next.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-user-1-conflict" class="section level2">
<h2>User 1: Conflict!</h2>
<p>After the <em>pull</em> that results in a conflict, <em>git</em>
leaves us in the middle of its attempt to <em>merge</em> all the changes
and wants us to fix things manually.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the current state of the file:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/110_conflict.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>There are some things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the <em>git</em> pane, files with unresolved conflicts are shown
with a <em>Status</em> of <code>U</code></li>
<li>those files will contain <em>one or more</em> sections delimited by
<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>=======</code> and
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We need to find each of those sections and fix them.</p>
<p>Notice these things about the conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li>our change to verse two <em>was not a conflict</em> because User 2
did not touch that part of the file</li>
<li>our change to verse four <em>was not a conflict</em> because User 2
made exactly the same changes</li>
<li>our change to verse six <strong><em>was a conflict</em></strong>
because we changed it differently to User 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking in the text we see this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle
Of the tramways and the buses making hurry down the street,
And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,
Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet.
=======
And in place of glowing corals, to reflect Hunt’s absent morals,
The muck and silt of mining spreads its foulness on the Reef,
And the language uninviting of the grubs in Parliament fighting
Progress, drowns the march of Science under ignorant Belief.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a5d202e4a67186a94f2d13dad4792913d9c32881</code></pre>
<p>It's showing us our local change and the remote change and expecting
us to remove everything from
<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code> to
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a5d202e4a67186a94f2d13dad4792913d9c32881</code>
(inclusive) and replace it with something sensible.</p>
<p>We can do pretty much anything we want here, it's just a normal
<em>edit <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> commit</em>
but the available options boil down to one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the first change (mine) discarding the other (theirs)</li>
<li>use the second change (theirs) discarding the first (mine)</li>
<li>synthesise the two into a combined solution</li>
<li>come up with something completely new and different (including
nothing) to use instead</li>
</ul>
<div id="section-an-humorous-aside..." class="section level3 aside">
<h3>An (humorous) aside...</h3>
<p>I had considered for the <em>synthesis</em> example using the first
verse of <em>Clancy</em> and the first verse from <em>The Raven</em> by
Edgar Allan Poe, and synthesising the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better,<br />
Knowledge, many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br />
He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,<br />
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</p>

</div>
<div id="section-user-1-resolving-the-conflict" class="section level2">
<h2>User 1: Resolving the conflict</h2>
<p>The conflict concerns the edits made for verse six. There are two
different versions:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/110_conflict.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>We're going to resolve this by choosing our version of verse six, so
we edit the file, removing the markers and the unwanted version, leaving
our version. Here we have saved the file but not yet added it for
<em>commit.</em></p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/120_commit_pre_add.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-warning..." class="section level3 anxiety">
<h3>Warning...</h3>
<p><span class="warning">It's very easy to forget to take out
<em>all</em> the <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> markers
<em>&amp;c.</em> or neglect to save the file.</span></p>
<p>Make sure you get them all by searching for the
<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> markers and save the file.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously:</p>
<p><span class="warning">It is very important not to just check the
check box when conflicts happen and blindly commit.</span></p>
<p>Neglecting to fix the conflicts will lead to the
<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>=======</code> and
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> markers and the different
versions of the text getting committed. This will in turn lead to more
conflicts down the track with nested marks and not-so-hilarious results.
Your colleagues will not thank you.</p>
<p>Because <em>git</em> keeps track of all the different versions,
nothing is irreparable if you do this, everything can be fixed as we
have a full history of all our files. Fixing a single
accidentally-committed conflict is relatively easy. Fixing nested
conflicts gets messy and confusing very fast so if you accidentally do
this, fix it as soon as possible.</p>
</div>
<p>At this point, if we were to edit the file and the result was
different to the last version we committed, <em>i.e.</em> we came up
with something new or we chose their version over ours, the
<em>RStudio</em> <em>git</em> pane UI would show the file as having been
modified when we select the <em>Staged</em> check box to <em>add</em>
our changes for <em>commit.</em></p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/121a_commit_post_add.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>However, in this case (which is not an uncommon case), after our
edits <em>our file is exactly the same as our last committed
version.</em> This means that the <em>git</em> pane will be empty
(because it only shows files which are different to our last
commit).</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/121_commit_post_add.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>This is counter-intuitive:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are changes we need to <em>commit</em> because we have
resolved a merge conflict</li>
<li>the UI is telling us there are no changes!</li>
</ul>
<p>The lesson to take away from this is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="warning">When a <em>pull</em> results in a conflict,
once the editing is complete, always <em>commit</em> afterwards to
resolved the conflict</span> even if the <em>git</em> pane is empty.</p>
<p><em>Git</em> will remain in a <em>merge</em> state until the next
<em>commit</em> so you may get unexpected behaviour.</p>
<div id="section-an-aside...-2" class="section level3 aside">
<h3>An aside...</h3>
<p>It's no disaster if you forget the <em>commit</em> after resolving
conflicts. Instead of having two commits, one with the resolution of the
conflict and one with subsequent changes you will just have one commit
(with both sets of changes). The result will be the same files, it's
just nicer looking back through the commit history to see one commit for
the <em>pull/merge</em> and a separate one for subsequent changes since
logically they are distinct.</p>
</div>
<p>Let's do the <em>commit</em> now after having fixed verse six.
Remember we're seeing no change because our current version is the same
as the last committed version but a commit is necessary.</p>
<p>Let's type in a sensible commit message to say what we did. Also note
that our current version is one commit ahead of
<code>origin/master</code> (that's our original changes which added
verses two, four and six).</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/122_commit.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>And we press the <em>Commit</em> button:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/123_commit_result.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>Note that now we are ahead of <code>origin/master</code> by two
commits:</p>
<ul>
<li>our original addition of verses two, four and six</li>
<li>the commit we just made to resolve conflicts after the
<em>pull</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at the commit history to see:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/124_commit_history.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>There we are: we've reconciled the two different versions and they've
merged back together.</p>
<p>As far as we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>our local repository has four sets of changes and we've merged them
together and are at that merged version</li>
<li>the remote <code>origin</code> repository is still behind us and
needs to be updated with a <em>push</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-user-1-pushing-the-resolution" class="section level2">
<h2>User 1: Pushing the resolution</h2>
<p>Our local repository is ahead of <code>origin/master</code> by two

<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/130_push_result.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>

<p>This will update our local idea of what's on the remote repository

<p>It's entirely possible more edits were made and we'll be asked to

happen that often.</p>

</div>
<p>User 2 has not made any conflicting changes so there are no further
conflicts and all the changes are applied.</p>
<p>In fact, User 2 has not made any changes so no merge is necessary:
<em>git</em> downloads the changes and skips ahead to the latest
version.</p>
<p>If we look at User 2's commit history now we can see it's the same as
User 1:</p>
<div class="screenshot">
<p><img src="images/141_pull_history.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>

repository.</p>

<div id="section-summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>By tracking all of our changes and where they are, <em>git</em> can
most of the time share those changes between repositories and apply the
changes automatically.</p>
<p>Occasionally, <em>git</em> needs our help because a <em>conflict</em>
arises when two conflicting edits have been made to the same thing.</p>
<p>When this happens, <em>git</em> requires us to</p>
<ul>
<li>examine the conflict(s)</li>
<li>resolve the conflict(s) by editing the files</li>
<li>commit the edits which resolve the conflict</li>
</ul>
<p>It's usually a good idea to <em>commit</em> immediately and restrict
the changes in the <em>commit</em> to just those necessary to resolve
the conflict.</p>
<p>Changes would usually then be shared back to the remote repository if
necessary using <em>push.</em>
