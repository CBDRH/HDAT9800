## Shiny

Shiny apps consist of a _user-interface_ running in a user's browser and a _server_ application with which it
communicates.

<div align="center">
![](images/shiny-architecture.png){width="50%"}
</div>

### The Shiny user interface (UI)

_Inputs_ in the UI are controlled by the user.
Their values are sent to the server which generates _outputs_.
The outputs are sent back to the UI.
The UI displays these outputs.

For example, here is a simple application consisting of a UI with one input and one output:

 * the input is a selection menu (drop down) containing a list of regions
 * the output is a plot
 
In this example, the input is called `region` and the output is called `phonePlot`.
You can see this in the example below

```{r shinyexample, echo=TRUE}
selectInput("region", "Region:", choices = colnames(WorldPhones))
plotOutput("phonePlot")
```

Try changing the input dropdown and you will see the plot changes appropriately.

```{r shinyexample-server, context="server"}
output$phonePlot = renderPlot({
  barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region] * 1000,
          ylab = "Number of Telephones", xlab = "Year")
})
```

### The Shiny server

The UI is communicating with a server running this code

```
output$phonePlot = renderPlot({
  barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region] * 1000,
          ylab = "Number of Telephones", xlab = "Year")
})
```

This is a very simple example.

This code says "create a barplot using the `region` input, render it for transmission and display and send it to the UI to be displayed in the output named `phonePlot`".

## The UI

The UI in our example consists of just two elements

 * a drop down input
 * a graph
 
A Shiny UI consists of a sequence of commands which builds up the HTML necessary to create the interface.

Shiny provides convenience functions to creates these input elements.
The user changes these to communicate information to the Shiny application.
They might be text input fields, menus, check boxes, radio buttons, anything that HTML provides to accept user input.

A lot needs to go on under the bonnet to make this work interactively and dynamically but thankfully that's
precisely the detail that Shiny hides from us and does for us.

### The drop down menu

The code

```
selectInput("region", "Region:", choices = colnames(WorldPhones))
```

creates a drop down menu called `region`.

In this form it takes

 * the name of the input: `region`
 * the label to be displayed in the UI: `"Region:"`
 * a vector of choices: `choices = colnames(WorldPhones)`

here we are just using the column names in the `WorldPhones` dataset.

```{r WorldPhones, echo=TRUE}
WorldPhones
```

<div class="under-the-bonnet">
### Under the bonnet...

This function (along with other Shiny UI functions) generates a `shiny.tag` object.

When rendered these `shiny.tag` objects produce the HTML which creates the UI.

```{r selectInput-example-1, echo=TRUE}
v <- selectInput("region", "Region:", choices = colnames(WorldPhones))
class(v)
```

We can see the HTML that would be generated by casting the output to be a string:

```{r selectInput-example-2, echo=TRUE}
as.character(v)
```

or in a slightly prettier format:

```
<div class="form-group shiny-input-container">
  <label class="control-label" for="region">Region:</label>
  <div>
    <select id="region"><option value="N.Amer" selected>N.Amer</option>
<option value="Europe">Europe</option>
<option value="Asia">Asia</option>
<option value="S.Amer">S.Amer</option>
<option value="Oceania">Oceania</option>
<option value="Africa">Africa</option>
<option value="Mid.Amer">Mid.Amer</option></select>
    <script type="application/json" data-for="region" data-nonempty="">{}</script>
  </div>
</div>
```

Even here, some details have been elided.
You can see why we want the application framework to do all of this for us.
</div>

### The graph

Just as the `selectInput()` function created the input element,
the `plotOutput()` function creates HTML to display information coming from the server for display to the user.

There are different output functions for different types of R output.
Here the code

```
plotOutput("phonePlot")
```

says

 * generate HTML to display a plot
 * use the information the server assigns to the output called `phonePlot` as the plot to display.
 
When we look at the server code we'll see the server generating a plot,
processing it into a form which can be sent to the UI
and then assigning it to the `phonePlot` output.

<div class="under-the-bonnet">
### Under the bonnet...

We can also look at the HTML code generated by `plotOutput()`.

Again, there are some details which have been left out but you can see it creates
a display element as a placeholder for the plot.

```{r plotOutput-example-1, echo=TRUE}
v <- plotOutput("phonePlot")
class(v)
```

We can see the HTML that would be generated by casting the output to be a string:

```{r plotOutput-example-2, echo=TRUE}
as.character(v)
```

or in a slightly prettier format:

```
<div id="phonePlot" class="shiny-plot-output" style="width: 100% ; height: 400px"></div>
```
</div>

## The Server

The code

```
  barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region] * 1000,
          ylab = "Number of Telephones", xlab = "Year")
```

creates a bar plot using the `WorldPhones` dataset.

This is wrapped in a function `renderPlot()` which takes a plot and does everything necessary
to make sure the UI knows about it and can display it.

```
renderPlot({
  barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region] * 1000,
          ylab = "Number of Telephones", xlab = "Year")
})
```

Note that the argument to `renderPlot()` is actually a _closure_
(a block of code surround by `{...}` like the body of a function).
Remember, a closure is code which is not executed immediately
but which is passed around for later execution. `renderPlot()`
(and indeed all the other render-type functions)
takes a closure because it will need to recalculate the plot whenever an input changes.

Finally, the output of `renderPlot()` is assigned to `output$phonePlot`.
The name `phonePlot` corresponds to the name used in the UI file in `plotOutput()`.

```
output$phonePlot = renderPlot({
  barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region] * 1000,
          ylab = "Number of Telephones", xlab = "Year")
})
```

### When does Shiny recalculate the output plot?

Shiny looks at the closure supplied to `renderPlot` and works out what inputs it depends on.
In this case the only input it depends on is `input$region`.

Shiny tries to keep recalculation to a minimum.
It will only recalculate `output$phonePlot` when it needs to, in this case, when `input$region` changes.

## Structuring Shiny applications

Historically a Shiny app was broken into two files:

 * ui.R — containing the UI code
 * server.R — containing the server code

These days a Shiny application can be contained in a single file

 * app.R — containing UI and server code

Whichever approach you use, these filenames must be used _exactly_.

Note that, these files need not contain every scrap of code comprising your application.
These files contain the _top level_ definitions of the UI and the server.
Code can be included from other files and normal software best practice can still be followed:

 * keeping related content in one file
 * separating unrelated content into separate files
 * breaking code up into separate files to make things more manageable
 
## The dual file approach

In the _dual file approach_ we have two separate files.
One file `ui.R` contains the UI definition.
Another files `server.R` contains the server definition.

### The UI file: ui.R

In this file we create the UI.

```
# ui.R

library(shiny)

fluidPage(
  sliderInput(inputId = "num",
    label = "Choose a number",
    value = 25,
    min = 1, max = 100),
  plotOutput("hist")
)
```

Previously saw just the tag functions to create elements of the Shiny UI.
Here we are creating an entire page.
The `fluidPage()` function takes a variable number of arguments and creates an HTML page.
The `fluidPage()` function takes an optional `title=` argument to set the page title.
See the documentation for other arguments.

<div class="under-the-bonnet">
### Under the bonnet...

Let's look at the HTML code generated by `fluidPage()`.

Here we've set the title and used simple elements, _e.g._ `p()` and `em()`, for illustrative purposes.

```
fluidPage(
  p("Paragraph 1"),
  p("Paragraph 2 contains", em("some emphasised text")),
  p("Trailing paragraph")
)
```

which gives

```
<div class="container-fluid">
  <p>Paragraph 1</p>
  <p>
    Paragraph 2 contains
    <em>some emphasised text</em>
  </p>
  <p>Trailing paragraph</p>
</div>
```

As you can see, it just concatenates the given elements.

Our actual example above

```
fluidPage(
  sliderInput(inputId = "num",
    label = "Choose a number",
    value = 25,
    min = 1, max = 100),
  plotOutput("hist")
)
```

generates

```
<div class="container-fluid">
  <div class="form-group shiny-input-container">
    <label class="control-label" for="num">Choose a number</label>
    <input class="js-range-slider" id="num" data-min="1" data-max="100" data-from="25" data-step="1" data-grid="true" data-grid-num="9.9" data-grid-snap="false" data-prettify-separator="," data-prettify-enabled="true" data-keyboard="true" data-data-type="number"/>
  </div>
  <div id="hist" class="shiny-plot-output" style="width: 100% ; height: 400px"></div>
</div>
```

</div>

### The server file: server.R

The `server.R` file contains the definition of the server's input/output function:

```
# server.R

library(shiny)

function(input, output) {
  output$hist <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$num))
  })
}
```

This function uses the input called `num` to generate the content of an output called `hist`.

Shiny apps do sophisticated things under the hood to work out what has changed
and what needs to be regenerated when inputs change.
Shiny apps do not simply recalculate everything every time something changes.

Shiny give us quite a bit of control over this _reactivity_ of outputs
but those details are for another time.

## The single file approach

In a _single file approach_ the UI and the server are defined in the same file
and the app instantiated from those two separate components.

```
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  sliderInput(inputId = "num",
    label = "Choose a number",
    value = 25,
    min = 1, max = 100),
  plotOutput("hist")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$hist <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$num))
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

<div class="aside">
### Aside...
Of course, as mentioned, there is no need to have all the code in a single file.

The single file approach just means that the application is _built_ in this single file called `app.R`.

Components of the application can be defined elsewhere and referred to in this file.

```
library(shiny)

ui <- buildMyUi(...)
server <- buildMyServer(...)

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
</div>

## Running Shiny apps

Shiny applications are run by calling `runApp()` with the name of the directory containing the `app.R`
(or `ui.R` and `server.R`) files.

```
runApp("myApp")
```

_RStudio_ recognises Shiny applications and provides a <span style='color: green'>&#x25B6;</span> _Run App_ button
at the top of the window to run the application.

Close the window or press the stop button &#x1F6D1; to stop the app

## Nicer user interfaces

The interfaces we have been constructing so far have been simple affairs with a primitive layout
consisting of sequential interface elements.

Shiny gives us utility functions to create more interesting (and better) interfaces.

In particular, the `titlePanel()`, `sidebarLayout()`, `sidebarPanel()` and `mainPanel()` functions
can be used to create an interface with:

 * a title across the top
 * a panel set off to one side to contain something like navigation or controls
 * the main page content

For example:

```
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("title panel"),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel("sidebar panel"),
    mainPanel("main panel")
  )
)
```

This would generate a page with the following structure:

<div align="center" class="screenshot">
![](images/basic-ui.png){width="50%"}
</div>

### Convenience functions

Shiny contains convenience functions corresponding to HTML elements:

 * `p()`
 * `h1()`, `h2()`, ..., `h6()`
 * `a()`
 * `br()`, `div()`, `span()`
 * `pre()`, `code()`
 * `img()`
 * `strong()`, `em()`
 * `HTML()`

which can be used to build the user interface and which works as one might expect:

<div class="bordered-container-fluid">
```{r ui-example, echo=TRUE}
fluidPage(
  titlePanel("My Shiny App"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(p("controls go here")),
    mainPanel(
      p("p creates a paragraph of text."),
      p("A new p() command starts a new paragraph. Supply a style attribute to change the format of the entire paragraph.", style = "font-family: 'times'; font-si16pt"),
      strong("strong() makes bold text."),
      em("em() creates italicized (i.e, emphasized) text."),
      br(),
      code("code displays your text similar to computer code"),
      div("div creates segments of text with a similar style. This division of text is all blue because I passed the argument 'style = color:blue' to div", style = "color:blue"),
      br(),
      p("span does the same thing as div, but it works with",
        span("groups of words", style = "color:blue"),
          "that appear inside a paragraph.")
    )
  )
)
```
</div>

## Input elements

Input elements (sometimes referred to as widgets) allow the user to control the shiny application

 * `actionButton`
 * `checkboxGroupInput`
 * `checkboxInput`
 * `dateInput`
 * `dateRangeInput`
 * `fileInput`
 * `helpText`
 * `numericInput`
 * `radioButtons`
 * `selectInput`
 * `sliderInput`
 * `submitButton`
 * `textInput`

They create HTML (and associated Javascript) to display the inputs
and send collected input information to the server.

The [Shiny Widget Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html) contains more examples
with code.

<div class="bordered-container-fluid">
```{r input-example, echo=TRUE}
fluidPage(
  titlePanel("censusVis"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      helpText("Create demographic maps with information from the 2010 US Census."),
      selectInput("var", 
                  label = "Choose a variable to display",
                  choices = list("Percent White", 
                                 "Percent Black",
                                 "Percent Hispanic", 
                                 "Percent Asian"),
                  selected = "Percent White"),
      sliderInput("range", 
                  label = "Range of interest:",
                  min = 0, max = 100, value = c(0, 100))
    ),
    mainPanel()
  )
)
```
</div>

## Output elements

Output elements tell Shiny _how to display_ the output in the application.

The code to tell Shiny _how to build_ the output lives in the server.

 * `dataTableOutput`
 * `htmlOutput`
 * `imageOutput`
 * `plotOutput`
 * `tableOutput`
 * `textOutput`
 * `uiOutput`
 * `verbatimTextOutput`

These elements broadly correspond to the type of the data being displayed.

Some packages extend this list.
For example, _leaflet_ provides output elements to display interactive maps.

There are two parts to output:

 * the UI display part
 * the server calculation part

The server must send what the UI expects, _i.e._ they should match.

```
ui <- fluidPage(
  sliderInput(inputId = "num",
    label = "Choose a number",
    value = 25,
    min = 1, max = 100),
  plotOutput("hist")                  <--- plotOutput
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$hist <- renderPlot({         <--- renderPlot
    hist(rnorm(input$num))
  })
}
```

Output server code chunks contain code to render output in a format suitable for the UI elements:

 * `renderDataTable`
 * `renderImage`
 * `renderPlot`
 * `renderPrint`
 * `renderTable`
 * `renderText`
 * `renderUI`

Render functions take a _closure_ (code surrounded by `{...}`) because it's an _anonymous function_.

Exactly like a function, Shiny needs this code not to be executed when it is first seen but at some later point
(when the input changes).

## Naming inputs and outputs

It is important that the names of your inputs in the UI match up with the names that the server function
expects in the server.

Similarly, it's important that the server assigns to outputs with names that match output elements in the UI.

Failure to use matching names will lead to nothing happening when you change input
or output getting lost and never displayed.

_**Case is important.**_

The name `myinput` is different to `myInput` and both are different to `MyInput`.

## What happens when inputs change?

Let's take a look at what happens when the user changes an input

 * the user changes the input
 * the change is sent from the UI to the server
 * the server determines which outputs depend on the input and recalculates them by running the closure for that output
 * the result(s) is/are sent back to the UI
 * the UI displays any change(s)

It's important to note:

 * a single input may result in multiple outputs changing
 * a single output may depend on multiple inputs

Consider the following application with the server code

```
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$checkbox1.status = renderText({
    if (input$checkbox1) {
      "is checked"
    } else {
      "is not checked"
    }
  })
  output$checkbox2.status = renderText({
    if (input$checkbox2) {
      "is checked"
    } else {
      "is not checked"
    }
  })
  output$numberOfCheckboxesChecked = renderText({
    sum(c(input$checkbox1, input$checkbox2))
  })
}
```

and the UI as follows:

<div class="bordered-container-fluid">
```{r sequence-example-ui, echo=TRUE}
fluidPage(
  checkboxInput("checkbox1", "Checkbox 1"),
  checkboxInput("checkbox2", "Checkbox 2"),
  hr(),
  p("Checkbox 1 ", textOutput("checkbox1.status", inline=TRUE)),
  p("Checkbox 2 ", textOutput("checkbox2.status", inline=TRUE)),
  p("The total number of checkboxes checked is: ", textOutput("numberOfCheckboxesChecked", inline=TRUE))
)
```
</div>

```{r sequence-example-server, context="server"}
output$checkbox1.status = renderText({
  if (input$checkbox1) {
    "is checked"
  } else {
    "is not checked"
  }
})
output$checkbox2.status = renderText({
  if (input$checkbox2) {
    "is checked"
  } else {
    "is not checked"
  }
})
output$numberOfCheckboxesChecked = renderText({
  sum(c(input$checkbox1, input$checkbox2))
})
```

Try checking and unchecking the checkboxes and see what happens.

Notice that:

 * changing the input `checkbox1` results in the outputs `checkbox1.status` and `numberOfCheckboxesChecked` changing
 * changing the input `checkbox2` results in the outputs `checkbox2.status` and `numberOfCheckboxesChecked` changing

Shiny works out which output must react to which changed inputs.

<div class="aside">
### Aside...

The server function has two arguments `input` and `output` which are lists.

When inputs change the updated `input` object and the `output` object are passed to the server function.
The server function recalculates the `output` slots as required.

The closures (code between the `{...}`) passed to the render functions for each output slot are only called when any inputs referred to in the closure are changed.

For example, looking at

```
output$numberOfCheckboxesChecked = renderText({
  sum(c(input$checkbox1, input$checkbox2))
})
```

we can see the closure `{sum(c(input$checkbox1, input$checkbox2))}`
which references `input$checkbox1` and `input$checkbox2`.
If either of these inputs changed the closure is executed.
(The code here relies on the fact that checkbox input values are TRUE or FALSE:
it creates a logical vector out of them and sums the number of TRUE values in the vector
giving the total number of checked checkboxes.)

If `input$checkbox1` is changed
the closures associated with `output$checkbox1.status` and `output$numberOfCheckboxesChecked` are executed
but the closure associated with ``output$checkbox2.status` is not executed
because it does not reference `input$checkbox1`.

Once the closure is executed the result is prepared for output (here it's just rendered as plain text)
and assigned to `output$numberOfCheckboxesChecked`.
This results in the UI `textOutput("numberOfCheckboxesChecked", inline=TRUE)` getting updated. 
</div>
 
## Summary

This concludes our introductory tutorial on Shiny.

Shiny applications consist of two parts:

 * the user interface (UI)
 * the server

These two parts communicate using named input and outputs.
