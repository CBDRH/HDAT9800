## Overview

This tutorial looks at the _ggplot2_ package for $\textsf{R}$
and is based on Andy Lin's
[_Introduction to ggplot2_ tutorial](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/intro_ggplot2/ggplot2_intro_slidy.html), used and adapted with permission of the author.

The _ggplot2_ package is a package for R which facilitates the creation of sophisticated layered statistical graphics.
It uses an underlying _grammar_ of graphics which allows graphs to be built up component-by-component
as opposed to editing pre-made graphs or trying to create one big lump of code to format a graph.
This approach allows individual aspects of a graph,
such as the colour of one particular data series or the transparency of an overlay,
to be easily varied independently of other aspects of a graph.

## Installing and using _ggplot2_

For your own projects,
if you're using RStudio the easiest way to install _ggplot2_ and the necessary dependencies
is to use the _Install_ button at the top of the _Packages_ pane.
Make sure the _Install dependencies_ checkbox is ticked.
Alternatively one can run `install.packages("ggplot2")` in the _Console._

To load the _ggplot2_ library in the console
make sure the checkbox next to the package name is ticked in the _Packages_ tab.

To use _ggplot2_ in a project make sure you include `library(ggplot2)` in the code.

The following code, inserted at the start of a project,
will check to see if _ggplot2_ is installed and stop if it is not installed with a warning:

```
if (!require("ggplot2", quietly=TRUE)) {
  stop("The ggplot2 package does not appear to be installed.")
}
```

This approach is only suitable if a small number of packages are needed
as it doesn't scale very well to large number of packages.
To manage many dependencies using a package management suite such as _pacman_ is recommended.
See <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/vignettes/Introduction_to_pacman.html>.

For this tutorial there is no need to install _ggplot2_ as it does it for you.
This tutorial also uses some other packages which will also be automatically included:

 * Hmisc
 * dplyr
 * tidyr
 * lme4
 * nlme
 * datasets (builtin to recent versions of $\textsf{R}$)

## The tidyverse

The _ggplot2_ package is one component of the suite of packages called
[_tidyverse_](https://www.tidyverse.org) designed for data science.

Although _ggplot2_ can be installed on its own,
installing other packages from the _tidyverse_ suite may be an option for some projects, including:

  * [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/): data management (_e.g._ filtering, selecting, sorting, processing by group)
  * [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/): tidying/restructuring data
  * [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/): reading data in other formats (Stata, SAS, SPSS)
  * [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/): string variable processing

See the [Tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) page for a full list.
See also the [IDRE R Data Management Seminar](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/seminars/r-data-management/).

## Online resources

There is comprehensive documentation for _ggplot2_ online at <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/>.

The _ggplot2_ websites goes into each function available in the package quite thoroughly.
Each function's help file typically contains detailed code and graph examples.

The author of _ggplot2_, Hadley Wickham, has a book
_ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis_, 2009, Springer, New York.
This book is short (200 pages) but dense.
The rendered book is not available for free
but the Rmarkdown source for the book is available at <https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book>. You can clone this repository to your computer (in RStudio, create a new project using version control (git), paste the URL for the GitHub repo for the book into the dialogue box, then, once cloned, you can build the book for local reading using the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book/blob/master/README.md) file).

RStudio also has a very useful _ggplot2_ cheat sheet (click the thumbnail images below to download it, or see the [complete list of RStudio cheet sheets for R](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)).

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/pngs/thumbnails/data-visualization-cheatsheet-thumbs.png){width="75%"}](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf)

## Introduction: a grammar of graphics

The _ggplot2_ library produces layered statistical graphics
using an underlying 'grammar of graphics' (the 'gg' bit)
to build graphs component-by-component rather than providing less-flexible premade graph formats.

Simple graphs can be produced with very little knowlege of the underlying grammar
but understanding the grammar will make use of _ggplot2_ even easier.
Knowing the grammar will also allow us to conceive of and implement new and improved graphs.
The grammar is easy to grasp.

_ggplot2_ allows the user to build a graph by adding concepts to a graph
rather than specifying multiple long lists of options.

A grammar of a language defines the rules of structuring words and phrases into meaningful expressions.
A _grammar of graphics_ defines the rules of structuring data and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.
[Leland Wilkinson](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/) (2005) designed the
[grammar](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/TheGrammarOfGraphics/GOG.html) upon which _ggplot2_ is based.

The elements of the grammar are:

  * **data**: variables mapped to aesthetic features of the graph.
  * **geoms**: objects/shapes on the graph.
  * **stats**: statistical transformations that summarise data, _e.g._ mean, confidence intervals
  * **scales**: mappings of aesthetic values to data values. Legends and axes display these mappings.
  * **coordinate systems**: the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.
  * **faceting**: splitting the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling).

Let's work through these...

## Data


Data for plotting with _ggplot2_ tools must be stored in a _data.frame_ (or a _tibble_, which is the enhanced _tidyverse_ version of the R _data.frame_, or an R object which can be treated like a _data.frame_, such as a `tbl()` reference to an external database table using the _dbplyr_ package which we examined in the Chapter 1 interactive session).

Objects of class _matrix_ cannot be used and will need to be converted to _data.frame_ before plotting.

Multiple data frames may be used in one plot, which is an advantage over other graphing systems.

All datasets used in this seminar are loaded with the $\textsf{R}$ packages used for this tutorial.

Let's start with the `Milk` dataset.
The Milk dataset contains 1337 observations with the following 4 variables:

  * **protein**: numeric, protein content of milk
  * **time**: numeric, time since calving
  * **cow**: an ordered factor, an identifier for the cow
  * **diet**: a factor, the diet of the cow, with 3 levels: `barley`, `barley+lupins`, `lupins`
  
Examine the first few rows of `Milk` using `head()`:

```{r examine-milk, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r examine-milk-solution}
head(Milk)
```

Thus, with _ggplot2_, prior to plotting, data must be available as one or more data frames (or equivalents, see above) to be used.
Because this tutorial is focussed on using _ggplot2_ and not the other aspects of data management and analysis,
it won't focus on the cleaning and analysis steps that are part of this data preparation -- instead we will mostly use pre-prepared data frames.

There is a worked example at the end which goes into slightly more detail.

## The `ggplot()` function

All graphics begin with specifying the `ggplot()` function

Note that although the name of the package is _ggplot2_,
the name of the function is `ggplot()`.

In the `ggplot()` function we specify the 'default' dataset
and map variables to aesthetics (aspects) of the graph.
By "default", we mean the dataset assumed to contain the variables specified.
The first layer for any _ggplot2_ graph is an _aesthetics_ layer.

We then add subsequent layers (of _geoms_, _stats_, _&c._), producing the actual graphical elements of the plot.

In the `ggplot()` function below the data set we are using is `Milk` as given by the `data` argument.

<div class="aside">
### An aside...

The first argument to ``ggplot()` is the `data` argument
so specifying this as a named argument is not strictly necessary
but it does make things more readable and helps protect against errors.
</div>

The second argument to `ggplot()` is an _aes_ (aesthetics) object
which specifies the aesthetic mappings to be used for the plot.
Here

  * the `Time` variable (column) from `Milk` is mapped to the x-axis
  * the `protein` variable is mapped to the y-axis

If you run this you will see that _an empty plot is output!_
  
```{r first-plot, exercise=TRUE}
# declare data and x and y aesthetics, 
# but no shapes yet
ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein))
```

This is the expected output of the above call.
We have told _ggplot()_ _what_ data from the `Milk` data frame we wish to plot
but we have not specified _how_ we want it to appear.

## _ggplot2_ is part of the _tidyverse_

<div class="aside">
### An aside...
_ggplot2_ functions all work properly with other _tidyverse_ packages, and thus the _tidyverse_/_dplyr_ pipe (`%>%`) can be used to "pipe" the first argument into the `ggplot()` function, thus the code below is exactly equivalenet to the example code given above:

```
Milk %>% ggplot(aes(x=Time, y=protein))
```
</div>

## Aesthetics: aes()

Aesthetics are the visually perceivable components of the graph.

We map variables from the data frame to aesthetics using the `aes()` element.

For example, we can map:

  * which variables appear on the x-axis and y-axis.
  * a classification variable to colours
  * a numeric variable to the size of graphical objects such as line width or data point size

Aesthetics that we specify are inherited by subsequent layers in our plot.
The mappings specified in `aes()` in the `ggplot()` function serve as our defaults.
They do not need to be respecified in subsequent layers.

Let's say that we want our data to be plotted as points in a scatterplot using `geom_point()`.
From the `ggplot2::geom_point` documentation (use `?ggplot2::geom_point`):

> The point geom is used to create scatterplots. The scatterplot is most useful for displaying the relationship between two continuous variables. It can be used to compare one continuous and one categorical variable, or two categorical variables, but a variation like `geom_jitter()`, `geom_count()`, or `geom_bin2d()` is usually more appropriate.

```{r geom_point, exercise=TRUE}
# geom_point inherits x=Time, y=protein
ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Now we can see the data!

<div class="aside">
### An aside...

Notice the syntax here:

  * we create the plot object using `ggplot()`
  * we _add_ subsequent plot layers using `+`

The result of the expression (plot + layer + layer + ...) is evaluated and when output we get a graph.
We're seeing the graph here because the expression is being evaluated and output immediately
in that same way that if we wrote `5 + 7` we'd get the result `12` immediately.

More on this later in the **Layers** section.
</div>

Additional `aes()` specifications for subsequent plot layers will override the default aesthetics for that layer only.

Let's add another layer to see this (notice our plot expression now has two layers `plot + layer + layer`).
The `color` mapping from `Diet` given in `aes(color=Diet)` only applies to the `geom_boxplot()` layer but not to the points produced by the `geom_point()` layer.

```{r geom_point-and-geom_boxplot, exercise=TRUE}
# color=Diet only applies to geom_boxplot
ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color=Diet))
```

Please note that we are **not** suggesting that this chart (above) represents good visualisation practice -- in fact, as a chart, it is very poor, but we have created it to illustrate the principles of the _ggplot2_ grammar and syntax.

Which aesthetics are required and which are allowed depends on the particular _geom_ being used.

Some example aesthetics:

  * `x`: positioning along x-axis
  * `y`: positioning along y-axis
  * `color`: colour of objects; for 2-d objects, the colour of the object's outline (compare to fill below)
    * notice the spelling
  * `fill`: fill colour of objects
  * `alpha`: transparency of objects, a value between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque)
  * `linetype`: how lines should be drawn (solid, dashed, dotted, _&c._)
  * `shape`: shape of markers in scatter plots
  * `size`: how large objects appear

### Mapping _vs_ setting

If we want the aesthetic to vary as a variable changes value
we map aesthetics to variables _inside_ the `aes()` function.
When mapped inside `aes()`, the aesthetic will vary as the variable varies.

Let's apply the change of colour to the scatterplot and remove the boxplot for now.

```{r varaible-colour-diet, exercise=TRUE}
# color varies as Diet varies
ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=Diet))
```

Notice now that the points in the `geom_plot` change colour according to diet.

If we set the value of an aesthetic attribute _outside_ an `aes()` mapping,
it gets set to a constant.

```{r green-diet, exercise=TRUE}
# map color to constant "green" outside of aes
ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point(color="green")
```

<div class="anxiety">
### Warning...

Setting an aesthetic to a constant _within_ `aes()` can lead to unexpected results,
as the aesthetic is then set to a default value rather than the specified value.

```{r constant-in-aes, exercise=TRUE}
# Colour set to 'green' but appears as default default red-orange colour instead
ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color="green"))
```
</div>

## Layers

Graphs in _ggplot2_ are built layer-by-layer, rather than being premade.
As we have already seen, we add more layers with the `+` operator.

A layer consists of graphics produced by either a _geom_ or _stat_ element.
We can add layers in a virtually unrestricted way, allowing us to customise our graphs as we see fit.

Remember that layers inherit default aesthetics from the `ggplot()` function,
but they can be overridden for each layer.

For example, we could construct a graph that begins whose first layer is a scatterplot of `Time` _vs_ `protein`:

```{r time-vs-protein, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Then add a layer of of line graphs connecting `Time` _vs_ `Protein` by cow
(Notice that we added the aesthetic `group=cow`)

```{r time-vs-protein-by-cow, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(group=Cow))
```

And finally, end with a layer which adds a smoothed estimate of the mean relationship:

```{r time-vs-protein-by-cow-with-smoothed-mean, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(group=Cow)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

These example tell us two things:

  * _ggplot2_ is very flexible
  * just because you can do something doesn't mean you _should_ do something

<div class="aside">
### An aside...

These plots communicate something but they're not communicating anything about `Milk` particularly well
with that layer of line graphs creating a complete visual mess.
They are poor plots in that regard.

In conjunction with the source code they _are_ communicating that _ggplot2_ is very flexible.
</div>

## Plot objects

As mentioned in a previous section,
we have been creating a plot object and adding layers to create new, more complex, plot objects.
The end result is a plot _once the expression is output._

We can store these plot objects in a variable to make our code more compact when we're doing
complex plots.

Notice _the plot isn't generated until the 'value' of the variable holding the plot is output._
The code below will generate no output until p is output.
Try running it unmodified and then add a `p` to output the plot and run it again

```{r store-plot-in-variable, exercise=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r store-plot-in-variable-solution}
p <- ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point()
p
```

Compare this to an analogous sitution with integers.
If we evaluate `5 + 7` we get `12`:

```{r integer-expression, exercise=TRUE}
5 + 7
```

If, however, we store that in a variable, we get no output
(running this example will assign `12` to `p` but result in no output):

```{r integer-assignment, exercise=TRUE}
p <- 5 + 7
```

But now that the value is in `p` we can evaluate `p` to get the result:

```{r integer-assignment-then-evaluation, exercise=TRUE}
p <- 5 + 7
p
```

_**A plot is generated when the 'value' of the plot expression is evaluated and output.**_

So, we would expect the following code to produce two plots:

```{r two-plots, exercise=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point()
p
p + geom_boxplot(aes(color=Diet))
```

Try commenting out the final two lines one at a time to see which is generating each plot.

This lets us create a base plot and then add different layers.
Let's use this as the base plot:

```{r baseplot, echo=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point()
```


Let's generate a plot with a smooth mean

```{r base-plus-smooth, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="baseplot"}

p + geom_smooth()

```

and another faceted by `Diet` (split the data by `Diet` and produce multiple plots)

```{r base-plus-facet, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="baseplot"}

p + facet_wrap(. ~ Diet)

```

Of course, these are plot expressions as well and can be stored for later use.
Notice here we're storing them and then outputting them in a different order.

```{r store-new-graphs, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="baseplot"}

base_plot <- p
facetted_plot <- base_plot + facet_wrap(. ~ Diet)

max_protein_by_time <- nlme::Milk %>% group_by(Time) %>% summarise(protein=max(protein))

facetted_plot + geom_smooth()
base_plot + geom_line(data=max_protein_by_time, color="Red")

```

<div class="aside">
### An aside...

We've been a bit fancy here with the `geom_line`:
we've generated a new data set (using _dplyr_) which has the maximum `protein` for each `Time` value
and used that explicitly as the data frame for the `geom_line`.
We'll examine this again in the worked example.
</div>

So, again, a reminder:

_**A plot is generated when the 'value' of the plot expression is evaluated and output.**_

## Geoms

The _geom_ functions differ in the geometric shapes produced for the plot:

  * `geom_bar()`: bars with bases on the x-axis
  * `geom_boxplot()`: boxes-and-whiskers
  * `geom_errorbar()`: T-shaped error bars
  * `geom_histogram()`: histogram
  * `geom_line()`: lines
  * `geom_point()`: points (scatterplot)
  * `geom_ribbon()`: bands spanning y-values across a range of x-values
  * `geom_smooth()`: smoothed conditional means, _e.g._ loess smooth

Each _geom_ is defined by aesthetics required for it to be rendered.
For example, `geom_point()` requires both `x` and `y`, the minimal specification for a scatterplot.

_Geoms_ differ in which aesthetics they accept as arguments.
For example, `geom_point()` understands and accepts the aesthetic `shape`,
which defines the shapes of points on the graph.
In contrast, `geom_bar()` does not accept `shape`.

Check the geom function help files for required and understood aesthetics.

Let’s take a look at some commonly used _geoms._

### Geoms requiring only x

Geoms that require only the `x` aesthetic be specified are often used to plot
the distribution of a single, continuous variable.

We’ll first map the variable `protein` to the x-axis in `ggplot()`,
save this specification in an object, and then we’ll subsequently add _geom_ layers.

```{r univariateplot, echo=TRUE}

# define data and x for univariate plots
univariate_base <- ggplot(Milk, aes(x=protein))

```

### Histograms

Histograms plot distributions of continuous variables.
Remember that `geom_histogram()` will be inheriting `aes(x=protein)` from `univariate_base`.

```{r histogram-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="univariateplot"}

# histogram
univariate_base + geom_histogram()

```

### Density plots

Density plots are effectively smoothed out histograms (using a kernel function, which we won't go into here).

```{r density-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="univariateplot"}

# density plot
univariate_base + geom_density()

```


### Bar plots

While histograms and density plots are used to display the distributions of continuous variables,
_bar plots_ are often used to display distributions of categorical/discrete variables.

`geom_bar()` by default produces a bar plot with counts of each x-value,
thus the base graph has been changed to use `Diet` for `x`:

```{r bar-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="univariateplot"}

# bar graph
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Diet)) + geom_bar()

```

### Geoms that require more than x

Plots of more than one variable are typically more interesting.
Let’s look at some _geoms_ that map variables to both the `x` and `y` aesthetics.

Let's change the base graph to one with `Time` mapped to the x-axis and `protein` to the y-axis.

```{r xybase, echo=TRUE}

xy_base <- ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein))

```

### Scatter plots

Let's add a scatterplot layer with `geom_point()`.
You should be familiar with this one by now:

```{r point-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

# scatterplot
xy_base + geom_point()

```

### Smoothed means

Here is just the smoothed mean, in this case, without the scatterplot:

```{r smooth-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

# smooth mean
xy_base + geom_smooth()

```

Of couse, layering lets us put both on the same graph as we have been doing:

```{r scatter-smooth-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

xy_base + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

```

Try `xy_base + geom_smooth() + geom_point()` and examine the difference when the layers are reordered. You can just edit and re-run the code in the code box above.
It might help if you make the points of the scatter plot a different colour by adding `color="Red"`

## Graphics by group

Often, we want to produce separate graphics by a grouping variable, all overlaid on the same group.

One way to graph by group is to use the `group` aesthetic.
Below, we create line graphs of `Time` _vs_ `protein`, individually by `Cow`.
Each line represents the many measurements across time of a single cow. The result is a mess!

```{r protein-by-cow, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

# lines of protein over Time by group=Cow
xy_base + geom_line(aes(group=Cow))

```

`geom_line()` connects points in the order in which they appear on the x-axis.
We usually need to use the `group` aesthetic for `geom_line()`
because otherwise, a single, nonsensical line graph of the entire dataset will be created
as we see below when `group` is omitted:

```{r line-plot-without-group, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

xy_base + geom_line()

```

Mapping variables to most other aesthetics besides `x` and `y` will implicitly group the graphics as well.

For example, we can group the data into lines by `Cow` by colouring them
(instead of using `group=Cow`), but that's not very useful either:

```{r colour-by-cow, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

# lines of protein over Time coloured by Cow
xy_base + geom_line(aes(color=Cow))

```

Let's try lines by `Cow`, but then grouped by `Diet` using `color`.
This grouping would potentially allow us to see if the trajectories of `protein` over time differed by `Diet`.

```{r colour-by-cow-and-diet, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

# lines of protein over Time by Cow coloured by Diet
xy_base + geom_line(aes(group=Cow, color=Diet))

```

or instead of `color` we could map `Diet` to `linetype`:

```{r linetype-by-cow-and-diet, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

# lines of protein over Time by Cow coloured by Diet
xy_base + geom_line(aes(group=Cow, linetype=Diet))

```

OK, none of those are very good! But they illustrate the flexibility of _ggplot2_, and the fact that trial-and-error and experimentation is sometimes required to arrive an an effective visualisation.

## Stats

The _stat_ functions statistically transforms data, usually as some form of summary.
For example:

  * frequencies of values of a variable (histogram, bar graphs)
  * a mean
  * a confidence limit

Each stat function is associated with a default _geom_, so no _geom_ is required for shapes to be rendered.
The _geom_ can often be respecified in the _stat_ for different shapes.

### stat_bin()

The `stat_bin()` _stat_ transforms a continuous variable mapped to `x` into bins (intervals) of counts.
Its default _geom_ is `geom_bar()`, producing a histogram.
(Remember, our `univariate_base` has `protein` mapped to `x`)

```{r stat_bin-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="univariateplot"}

# stat_bin() produces a bar graph by default
univariate_base + stat_bin()

```

Respecifying the _geom_ to `geom=line` changes how the statistical transformation is depicted.

```{r stat_bin-line-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="univariateplot"}

# a line instead of bars
univariate_base + stat_bin(geom="line")

```

Note that the _geom_ is just specified as `"line"` not `geom_line()`.

### stat_summary()

`stat_summary()` applies a summary function (_e.g._ `mean`) to `y` at each value or interval of `x`.

The default summary function is `mean_se`, which returns the mean ± standard error.
Thus, `stat_summary()` plots the mean and standard errors for `y` at each `x` value.

The default _geom_ is `geom_pointrange()`,
which places a dot at the mean of `y` (for that `x`) and extends lines to mean ± s.e.

Let's plot means and standard errors of `protein` (mapped to `y`),
at each `Time` (mapped to `x`) using the default _geom_ `geom_pointrange()`.

```{r stat_summary-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

# plot mean and standard error of protein at each Time
xy_base + stat_summary()

```

You might recognise this shape.
Add a `geom_smooth()` to the plot below.
You will want to think about the order of the layers.

```{r stat_summary-with-smooth, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

xy_base + stat_summary()

```

```{r stat_summary-with-smooth-solution, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

xy_base + geom_smooth() + stat_summary()

```

Exploring data graphically is easy with _ggplot2_.

### Using other summary functions and geoms with stat_summary()

Generally, functions that accept continuous numeric variables (_e.g._ mean, var, user-written)
can be specified in `stat_summary()`, either with argument `fun.data` or `fun`.

The _ggplot2_ package conveniently provides additional summary functions adapted from the _Hmisc_ package,
for use with `stat_summary()`, including:

  * `mean_cl_boot`: mean and bootstapped confidence interval (default 95%)
  * `mean_cl_normal`: mean and Gaussian (t-distribution based) confidence interval (default 95%)
  * `mean_dsl`: mean plus or minus standard deviation times some constant (default constant=2)
  * `median_hilow`: median and outer quantiles (default outer quantiles = 0.025 and 0.975)

It is not necessary to load the _Hmisc_ package into the R session to use these functions,
but it is necessary if we want to view their help files.

If the new summary function returns 1 value (_e.g._ mean, var),
use argument `fun` and a _geom_ that requires only a single `y` input (_e.g._ `geom_point`, `geom_line`).

```{r stat_summary-customised, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

# median returns 1 value but geom_pointrange expects 2 (high, low)
# so change the geom to point
xy_base + stat_summary(fun="median", geom="point")

```

If the function resturns 3 values, such as the mean and 2 limits (_e.g._ mean_sem,  mean_cl_normal) use `fun.data`.

```{r stat_summary-mean-and-limits, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase"}

# mean and boostrapped confidence limits
xy_base + stat_summary(fun.data="mean_cl_boot")

```

We can even define our own functions:

```{r stat_summary-user-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase", exercise.lines=7}

# we define our own function mean of log, which only returns 1 value,
# so we also change geom to line 
meanlog <- function(y) {
  mean(log(y))
}

xy_base + stat_summary(fun=meanlog, geom="line")

```

Notice our `y` axis is mislabelled now.
The `y` values are `log(protein)` now not `protein`.
The _scale_ `ylab("label")` sets the `y` axis label to `label`
(we'll look more at _scales_ in a moment).
Add a _scale_ to change the `y` label to `log(protein)`.

```{r stat_summary-user-function-with-label, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="xybase", exercise.lines=7}

# we define our own function mean of log, which only returns 1 value,
# so we also change geom to line 
meanlog <- function(y) {
  mean(log(y))
}

xy_base + stat_summary(fun=meanlog, geom="line")

```

```{r stat_summary-user-function-with-label-solution}

# we define our own function mean of log, which only returns 1 value,
# so we also change geom to line 
meanlog <- function(y) {
  mean(log(y))
}

xy_base + stat_summary(fun=meanlog, geom="line") + ylab("log(protein)")

```

## Scales

_Scales_ define **how** aesthetic values are mapped to data values.

The _ggplot2_ package usually allows the user to control the _scales_ for each aesthetic.
Look for _scale_ functions called something like <code>scale_<em>aesthetic</em>_manual()</code>
(where _aesthetic_ is replaced with a particular aesthetic attribute)
to specify exactly which visual elements will appear on the graph.

The default shape _scale_ will map `Diet` values
`"barley"` to circle,
`"barley+lupins"` to triangle,
and `"lupins"` to square symbols:

```{r shape-example, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein, shape=Diet)) +
  geom_point()
```

Of course, we could combine this with varying the colour by `Diet` as well.
Add an argument to map `Diet` to colour as well in the `aes()`:

```{r shape-example-with-colour, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein, shape=Diet)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r shape-example-with-colour-solution}
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein, shape=Diet, color=Diet)) +
  geom_point()
```

Shape scales give us control over which symbols correspond to which values.
A different shape scale could map the `Diet` values to diamond, plus, and asterisk symbols.
Below we use `shape_scale_manual()` to specify the numeric codes corresponding to those shpaes.
For a list of those codes,
see [the bottom of the `scale_shape()` manual page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_shape.html).

```{r shape-scale-override, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein, shape=Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_shape_manual(values=c(5, 3, 8))
```

We can even supply our own shapes for plotting, here the characters 'B', 'M', and 'L':

```{r shape-scale-letters-override, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein, shape=Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_shape_manual(values=c("B", "M", "L"))
```

<div class="aside">
### An aside...

The table of shape symbols is produced by the code below.

You should have enough of an understanding of _ggplot2_ to work how the code results in the chart.

Some things it might help to know:

  * `scale_shape_identity()` is used when the data is already aesthetic values _ggplot2_ can understand.
    In this case our `shape` variable in the `df_shapes` data frame contains the shape ids we want to use
  * `facet_wrap(. ~ shape)` creates a sub-plot for each value of `shape`
  * `theme_void` turns off all the decoration like axis labels and guidelines

```{r table-of-shapes, exercise=TRUE}
# Show a list of available shapes
df_shapes <- data.frame(shape = 0:24)
ggplot(df_shapes, aes(0, 0, shape = shape)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = shape), size = 5, fill = 'red') +
  scale_shape_identity() +
  facet_wrap(. ~ shape) +
  theme_void()
```

Notice that some of the shapes are solid (they only use the line colour)
while others are filled (they also use the `fill` colour).

Try taking the `theme_void()` off the end (don't forget to remove the `+` before it on the previous line as well).
It will look messy but it will clearly show the different sub-plots.
You'll also be able to see that each _shape_ is being plotted at the origin of each sub-plot
because of the explicit data we are specifying for `x` and `y`: `0` and `0`.
</div>

### Colour scale functions

As colour is an important marker of variation in graphs,
_ggplot2_ provides many scale functions designed to make controlling colour scales simpler.

<div class="anxiety">
### A note about colour

Colour is a powerful tool for differentiating in plots.

Colour is also one of the harder attributes to use well.

The meaning of colour can be informed by culture:

  * a 'safe' colour in one culture might indicate 'danger' in another culture
  * a 'neutral' colour in one culture might indicate 'death' in another culture
  
In addition, there are many different types of colour-blindness which affect people of
different backgrounds and phenotypic sex differently.

|                                                 | Males   | Females |
|:------------------------------------------------|:--------|:--------|
| **Dichromacy**                                  | 2.4%    | 0.03%   |
| Protanopia (red deficient: L cone absent)       | 1.3%    | 0.02%   |
| Deuteranopia (green deficient: M cone absent)   | 1.2%    | 0.01%   |
| Tritanopia (blue deficient: S cone absent)      | 0.001%  | 0.03%   |
| **Anomalous trichromacy**                       | 6.3%    | 0.37%   |
| Protanomaly (red deficient: L cone defect)      | 1.3%    | 0.02%   |
| Deuteranomaly (green deficient: M cone defect)  | 5.0%    | 0.35%   |
| Tritanomaly (blue deficient: S cone defect)     | 0.0001% | 0.0001% |

Table: Rates of colour blindness

</div>

For our examples here,
we will use _scales_ for fill colours to adjust which three colours are mapped to the three values of `Diet`:

  * `scale_fill_hue()`: evenly spaced hues, default used for _factor_ variables
  * `scale_fill_brewer()`: sequential, diverging or qualitative colour schemes,
     originally intended to display factor levels on a map.

The function `scale_fill_brewer()` pulls its colour from the website [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org),
which provides premade colour palettes desinged to show contrast among discrete values.

The plots are densities of `protein` for each `Diet` group.
Let's set up our base graph:

```
dDiet <- ggplot(Milk, aes(x=protein, fill=Diet)) + 
  geom_density(alpha=1/3) # makes all colours semi-transparent
```

```{r scalesetup, echo=TRUE}
dDiet <- ggplot(Milk, aes(x=protein, fill=Diet)) + 
  geom_density(alpha=1/3) # makes all colours semi-transparent
```

Here are four fill colour scales produced by the above two functions.

First the default colour scale.

```{r scale-example-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="scalesetup"}
# the default is scale_fill_hue, would be the same if omitted
dDiet + scale_fill_hue()
```

As noted, `scale_fill_hue()` is the default.
Try taking it out and running the code again, you should get the same plot.

```{r scale-example-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, exercise.setup="scalesetup"}
# the default is scale_fill_hue, would be the same if omitted
dDiet + scale_fill_hue()
```

Let's try a 'qualitative' scale using `scale_fill_brewer()`.

```{r scale-example-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="scalesetup"}
# a qualitative scale for Diet in scale_fill_brewer
dDiet + scale_fill_brewer(type="qual")
```

And finally a 'divergent' scale using `scale_fill_brewer()`.

```{r scale-example-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="scalesetup"}
# a divergent scale for Diet in scale_fill_brewer
dDiet + scale_fill_brewer(type="div")
```

### Setting axis limits and labelling scales

Earlier we used `ylab` to change the label of the `y` axis.

_Axes_ visualise the _scales_ for the aesthetics `x` and `y`.
To adjust the axes use:

  * `lims`, `xlim`, `ylim`: to set axis limits
  * `expand_limits`: to extend limits of _scales_ for various aethetics
  * `xlab`, `ylab`, `ggtitle`, `labs`: to give labels (titles) to the x-axis, y-axis, or graph as a whole;
    `labs` can set labels for all aesthetics and title in one go
    
Let's return to our familiar plot of `protein` versus `Time`.

```{r familiar-plot, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) +
  geom_point()
```

Let's use `lims()` to restrict the range of the two axes
and use `labs()` to relabel them.

```{r restricted-plot, exercise=TRUE}
# notice the restricted ranges of x-axis and y-axis
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) +
  geom_point() +
  lims(x=c(5, 10), y=c(3, 4)) +
  labs(x="Weeks", y="Protein Content")
```

## Guides

_Guides_ (axes and legends) visualise a _scale_, displaying data values and their matching aesthetic values.
The x-axis, a _guide_, visualises the mapping of data values to position along the x-axis.
A colour scale _guide_ (legend) displays which colours map to which data values.

Most _guides_ are displayed by default.
The `guides()` function sets and removes _guides_ for each _scale._

Add `guides(shape="none")` to the following plot to remove remove the shape _scale_ legend.

```{r remove-guide, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# base plot with Diet mapped to shape
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein, shape=Diet)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r remove-guide-solution}
# notice no legend on the right anymore
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein, shape=Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  guides(shape="none")
```

## Coordinate systems

_Coordinate systems_ define the planes on which objects are positioned in space on the plot.
Most plots use Cartesian coordinate systems.
All the plots in the seminar use the Cartesian coordinate system.
Nevertheless, _ggplot2_ provides multiple coordinate systems, including polar, flipped Carteisan and map projections.

## Facetting (panelling)

We can split plots into small multiples (panels) with the faceting functions,
`facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()`.
The resulting graph shows how each plot varies along the faceting variable(s).

`facet_wrap() wraps a ribbon of plots into a multirow panel of plots.
The number of rows and columns can be specified
Multiple faceting variables can be separated using `+`.

Let's look at the densities of protein, coloured by Diet, faceted by Time.

Take the plot without facets and add `facet_wrap(. ~ Time)` to facet by `Time`.

```{r facet_wrap-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# densities of protein, coloured by Diet
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=protein, color=Diet)) + 
  geom_density()
```

```{r facet_wrap-example-solution}
# densities of protein, coloured by Diet, faceted by Time
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=protein, color=Diet)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(. ~ Time)
```

`facet_grid()` allows direct specification of which variables are used to split the data/plots
along the rows and columns.
Put the row-splitting variable before `~`, and the column-splitting variable after.
A `.` specifies no faceting along that dimension.

```{r facet_grid-example, exercise=TRUE}
# split rows by Diet, no splitting along columns
ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(Diet ~ .)
```

Try replacing `facet_grid(Diet ~. )`with `facet_grid(. ~ Diet)` and see what happens.

## Themes

_Themes_ control elements of the graph not related to the data.
For example:

  * the background colour
  * the size of fonts
  * gridlines
  * the colour of labels

These data-independent graph elements are known as _theme_ elements.

A list of _theme_ elements can be found on the
[tidyverse theme reference page for _ggplot2_](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html).

Each _theme_ element can be classified as one of three basic elements:

  * a line,
  * a rectangle, or
  * text.
  
Each basic element has a corresponding `element_` function
that allows control over graphical aspects of that element:

  * `element_line()`: can specify coluor, size, linetype, _&c._
  * `element_rect()`: can specify fill, colour, size, _&c._
  * `element_text()`:  can specify family, size, colour, _&c._
  * `element_blank()`: removes theme elements from graph
  
For example, the visual aspects of the x-axis can be controlled with `element_line()`,
in which we can change the colour, width, and linetype of the x-axis.
On the other hand,
the background of the graph can be controlled with `element_rectangle()`,
in which we can specify the fill colour, the border colour, the size of the background.

Set a graphical element to `element_blank()` to remove it from the graph.

Within the `theme()` function, we set the properties of _theme_ elements
by specifying the arguments of the `element_` functions.

For example, the _theme_ element corresponding to the background of the graph is `panel.background`, 
and its properties are set using the basic element function `element_rect()`.
We can adjust the background's fill colour, border colour, and size in `element_rect()`.
All of this will be specified within a call to `theme()`.

Below change the fill colour of the background to 'lightblue' using a call to `theme()`
and setting to the `panel.background` arguments to an `element_rect()` with a `fill` of `"lightblue"`.

```{r themesetup, echo=TRUE}
pt <- ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r theme-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, exercise.setup="themesetup"}
# default background
pt
```

```{r theme-example-solution}
# light blue background
pt + theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill="lightblue"))
```

Now specify the x-axis title, a text theme element, to be `size=20` (in points) and `red`.

```{r theme-example-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, exercise.setup="themesetup"}
pt + theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill="lightblue"))
```

```{r theme-example-2-solution}
pt + theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill="lightblue")) +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_text(size=20, color="red"))
```

Theme elements can be removed by setting them to `element_blank()`.
Let's remove y-axis title.

```{r theme-example-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, exercise.setup="themesetup"}
pt + theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill="lightblue"),
           axis.title.x=element_text(size=20, color="red"))
```

```{r theme-example-3-solution}
pt + theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill="lightblue"),
           axis.title.x=element_text(size=20, color="red"),
           axis.title.y=element_blank())
```

## Saving plots to files

`ggsave()` makes saving plots easy.
The last plot displayed is saved by default, but we can also save a plot stored to an R object.

`ggsave()` attempts to guess the device to use to save the image from the file extension,
so use a meaningful extension.
Available devices include:

  * eps/ps
  * tex (pictex)
  * pdf
  * jpeg
  * tiff
  * png
  * bmp
  * svg
  * wmf

The dimensions of the image can be specified as well.

Change the filename in the call to `ggsave()` below to specify where you want to save your file
(the example code saves it as a file called `myplot.png` in your home folder) and save it.
Find the file and view it to check it has our familiar plot it in.

```{r ggsave-example, exercise=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + geom_point()
ggsave("~/myplot.png", plot=p, width=7, height=5, units="cm")
```

## Worked example: ToothGrowth

This example illustrates how _ggplot2_ can be used at all stages of data analysis
including data exploration, model diagnostics, and reporting of model results.

The `ToothGrowth` dataset loads with the _datasets_ package.

The data are from an experiment examining how vitamin C dosage delivered in 2 different methods
predicts tooth growth in guinea pigs.
The data consist of 60 observations, representing 60 guinea pigs, and 3 variables:

  * `len`: numeric, tooth length
  * `supp`: factor, supplement type, 2 levels, `VC` is ascorbic acid, and `OJ` is orange juice
  * `dose`: numeric, dose (mg/day)

For this study, we treat `len` as the outcome, and `supp` and `dose` as the predictors.

Below we examine the structure of the dataset,
and then using `unique()`, we see that three doses were used, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0.

```{r toothgrowth-1, exercise=TRUE}
# look at ToothGrowth data
str(ToothGrowth)
# find unique doses
unique(ToothGrowth$dose)
```

It's recommended to graphically explore a dataset before beginning statistical modeling.
In particular, familiarise yourself with distributions of individual variables
as well as joint distibutions or relationships among groups of variables.

To be clear, this is not a recommendation to formulate your statistical model based on graphical exploration of the data,
as it is generally unwise to generate a model for a population
based upon the characteristics of a single sample of that population.
However, knowing more about variation in your data will help you interpret
and identify problems in your statistical models.

We begin our exploration of Toothgrowth by examining the distributions of `supp` and `dose`, our predictors.
Since both variables are discretely distributed, we want the frequencies (counts) of each value for both variables.

Frequencies are often plotted as bars, so we use `geom_bar()` to visualise.

We can of course produce bar graphs of `supp` and `dose` separately, like so:

```{r toothgrowth-2, exercise=TRUE}
# bar plots of supp and dose
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=supp)) + geom_bar()
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=dose)) + geom_bar()
```

Even better would be to show the joint distribution of `supp` and `dose`,
_i.e._ how `dose` is distributed at each `supp` (or _vice versa_).
So we want distributions of `dose`, grouped by `supp`.
We can group by `supp` on a graph by colouring by `supp`.

For bar _geoms_, the `color` aesthetic controls the border colour of the bar,
while the `fill` aesthetic controls the inner colour.

```{r toothgrowth-3, exercise=TRUE}
# bar plot of counts of dose by supp
# data are balanced, so not so interesting
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=dose, fill=supp)) + geom_bar()
```

Now we can see that the distribution of `dose` is balanced across both `supp` types.
Thus, `supp` and `dose` are uncorrelated, as will be their effects on `len`.

Statistical models often make assumptions about the distribution of the outcome (or its residuals),
so an inspection might be wise.
First let's check the overall distribution of `len` with a density plot:

```{r toothgrowth-4, exercise=TRUE}
# density of len
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=len)) + geom_density()
```

We can get densities of `len` by `supp` by mapping `supp` to `color`:

```{r toothgrowth-5, exercise=TRUE}
# density of len by supp
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=len, color=supp)) + geom_density()
```

The outcome distributions appear a bit skewed, but the samples are small.

Recall that the purpose of the study was to see how `dose` predicts length (`len`) across two supplement types,
orange juice and vitamin C.
We plan to use linear regression to model this.

To preview, we can create a scatter plot of the dose-tooth length (`len`) relationship.

Let's start by saving the base graph in a variable and work from there:

```{r toothgrowthscattersetup, echo=TRUE}
tp <- ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=dose, y=len))
```


```{r toothgrowth-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="toothgrowthscattersetup"}
# not the best scatterplot
tp + geom_point()
```

This is not the best scatterplot.
Because dose takes on only 3 values, many points are crowded in 3 columns,
obscuring the shape of relationship between `dose` and `len`.
Let's replace the column of points at each `dose` value with its mean and standard error bars
using `stat_summary()` instead of `geom_point()`.

```{r toothgrowth-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="toothgrowthscattersetup"}
# mean and cl of len at each dose
tp.1 <- tp + stat_summary()
tp.1
```

An additional call to `stat_summary()` with `fun=mean`
(we use `fun` because `mean` returns one value)
and changing the _geom_ to `"line"` adds a line between means.

```{r toothgrowthscattersetup8}
tp <- ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=dose, y=len))
tp.1 <- tp + stat_summary()
```

```{r toothgrowth-8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="toothgrowthscattersetup8"}
# add a line plot of means to see dose-len relationship
tp.2 <- tp.1 + stat_summary(fun="mean", geom="line")
tp.2
```

That graph appears a bit non-linear.

Let’s examine whether the `dose`-`len` relationship varies by `supp`.
We can specify new global aesthetics with a new `aes()` layer,
which will override the default aesthetics specified in the orginal `ggplot()` function.

Mapping `supp` to the `color` aesthetic will vary the colour of `geom_point()` symbols and `geom_line()` lines.

```{r toothgrowthscattersetup9}
tp <- ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=dose, y=len))
tp.1 <- tp + stat_summary()
tp.2 <- tp.1 + stat_summary(fun="mean", geom="line")
```

```{r toothgrowth-9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="toothgrowthscattersetup9"}
# all plots in tp.2 will now be coloured by supp
tp.2 + aes(color=supp)
```

This graph suggests:

  * The slope of the `dose`-response curve is not constant across `dose` for both `supp` types,
    suggesting a non-linear function.
  * The shape of the curves looks somewhat different between `supp`
  * At lower doses, `OJ` tends to be associated with longer lengths than `VC`,
    but this difference disappears at higher doses
    
We just plotted means and confidence limits of `len`,
with lines connecting the means, separated by `supp`, all without any manipulation to the original data!

The `stat_summary()` function facilitates looking at patterns of means, just as regression models do.

Next we fit our linear regression model and check model assumptions with diagnostic graphs.

### Linear regression model

Imagine that before looking at these exploratory graphs,
we hypothesised that `dose` has a linear relationship with tooth length (`len`)
and that the linear function might be moderated by supplement type (`supp`).

We will use `lm()` to run this regression model.

```{r lm-setup, echo=TRUE}
model_lin <- lm(len ~ dose * supp, data=ToothGrowth)
summary(model_lin)
```

The model results suggest that tooth length (`len`) increases with `dose`
and that supplement (`supp`) moderates this relationship.

### Diagnostic graph: residuals _vs_ fitted

Validity of the inferences drawn from a statistical model depend on the plausibility of the model assumptions.
Diagnostic graphs allow us to assess these assumptions, which are often untestable.

First we assess the assumptions of homoscedasticity, or constant error variance,
and linear relationships between the outcome and predictors.
A residuals _vs_ fitted (predicted value) plot assesses both of these assmuptions.
To make this plot, we'll need fitted (predicted) values and residuals

```
# add model fitted values and residuals to dataset
ToothGrowth$fit <- predict(model_lin)
ToothGrowth$res <- residuals(model_lin)
```

```{r lmsetup2, echo=FALSE}
ToothGrowth <- datasets::ToothGrowth
model_lin <- lm(len ~ dose * supp, data=ToothGrowth)
ToothGrowth$fit <- predict(model_lin)
ToothGrowth$res <- residuals(model_lin)
```

Now we are ready to make the graph, layer-by-layer

  * First specify aesthetics in ggplot(), where we map `fit` to `x`, `res` to `y`, and `supp` to `color`
  * A geom_point() scatter plot layer
  * A geom_smooth() layer to visualise the trend line with

An even spread of residuals around 0 suggests homoscedasticity,
and a zero, flat trend line suggests linearity of predictor effects.

```{r validation-graph, warning=FALSE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=10, exercise.setup="lmsetup2"}






```

```{r validation-graph-hint-1}
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=fit, y=res, color=supp)) + ...
```

```{r validation-graph-hint-2}
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=fit, y=res, color=supp)) +
  geom_point() + ...
```

```{r validation-graph-hint-3}
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=fit, y=res, color=supp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

We have suppressed several warnings regarding singularities,
likely arising due to the sparsity of the data along the x-dimension.

Nevertheless, we see that the trend lines are clearly not flat,
suggesting non-linear effects of `dose`, perhaps for both supplement types.
Our exploratory graphs support this.

At this point, we have to decide whether we believe the non-linear relationship is true of the population
or particular to this sample.

Regarding homoscedasticity, the data points do not look particularly more scattered at any fitted value
or supplement type, so this assumption seems plausible.

### Modeling a quadratic dose effect

Because it seems plausible that increasing dose would have diminishing returns,
let’s try modeling a quadratic effect.
We create a dose-squared variable, for use in the quadratic model and prediction later.

Then we run the new regression model, with linear and quadratic dose terms interacted with supp.
We then show that the quadratic model has a signficantly lower AIC,
indicating superior fit to the data, and then finally output the model coefficients:

```{r toothgrowth-dosesq, echo=TRUE}
# create dose-squared variable
ToothGrowth$dosesq <- ToothGrowth$dose ^ 2

# model with linear and quadratic effects interacted with supp
model_quad <- lm(len ~ (dose + dosesq)*supp, data=ToothGrowth)
AIC(model_lin, model_quad)
summary(model_quad)
```

Although the individual interaction coefficients are not signficiant,
they are jointly significant (checked _via_ likelihood ratio test, not shown).

Let's redo the residuals _vs_ fitted plot for the quadratic model:

```{r toothgrowth-dosesq-fit, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# get fitted values and residuals, quad model
ToothGrowth$fit_q <- predict(model_quad)
ToothGrowth$res_q <- residuals(model_quad)

# residuals vs fitted again
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=fit_q, y=res_q, color=supp)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

The trend lines appear flat.

<div class="aside">
### An aside...

If warnings regarding singularites are worrisome we can try an alternative
residuals _vs_ fitted plot without a loess smooth.
We simply replace the `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()` layers with a `stat_summary()` layer,
which will plot the mean and standard errors of the residuals at each fitted value:

```{r toothgrowth-dosesq-fit-alternative, echo=TRUE}
# means and standard errors of residuals at each fitted value
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=fit_q, y=res_q, color=supp)) + 
  stat_summary()
```

The means appear to lie along a flat line.
</div>

### Diagnostic plot: q-q plot

A q-q plot can assess the assumption that the residuals are normally distributed
by plotting the standardised residuals (observed z-score)
against theoretical quantiles of the normal distribution (expected z-score if normally distributed).

We will need standardised residuals for this plot, which we obtain with the function `rstandard()`.

`stat_qq()` creates a q-q plot.
The only required aesthetic is `sample`, which we map to the standardised residual variable.

A diagonal reference line (intercept=0, slope=1) is added to the plot with `geom_abline()`,
representing perfect fit to a normal distribution.

```{r qq-plot-setup}
ToothGrowth <- datasets::ToothGrowth
```

```{r qq-plot, echo=TRUE}
# add standardises residuals to data set
ToothGrowth$res_stand <- rstandard(model_quad)

# q-q plot of residuals and diagonal reference line
# geom_abline default aesthetics are yintercept=0 and slope=1
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(sample=res_stand)) + 
  stat_qq() + 
  geom_abline()
```

The normal distribution appears to be a reasonable fit.

Although we could more thoroughly assess model assumptions, let's move on to presenting the model results.

### Customizing a plot for presentation

We have decided to present our model dose-response curves with confidence intervals for an audience.
Because we are presenting it to an audience, we are more concerned about its visual qualities.

Our model implies smooth, quadratic dose functions
so we predict fitted values at more finely spaced doses than in the original data (0.5,1,2).

First we create the new dataset of doses between 0.5 and 2, separated by 0.01
and a corresponding dose-squared variable.
Then, we use `predict()` to add fitted values and confidence bands estimates to the new dataset.

```{r presentation-1, echo=TRUE}
# create new data set of values from 0.5 to 2 for each supp 
newdata <- data.frame(dose=rep(seq(0.5, 2, .01),each=2), 
                      supp=factor(c("OJ", "VC")))
# dose squared variable
newdata$dosesq <- newdata$dose ^ 2

#snapshot of the data we will use to get predicted values
head(newdata)
```

Now we add predicted values from the model:

```{r presentation-2, echo=TRUE}
# add predicted values and confidence limits to newdata 
newdata <- data.frame(newdata,
                      predict(model_quad, newdata, interval="confidence"))
# take a look
head(newdata)
```

### Initial plot: fitted vs dose by supp

Our planned plot will show the model predicted values of tooth length
across a range of doses from 0.5 to 2 for both supplement types.

Again, we build the plot layer by layer:

  * in `ggpplot()` we map `dose` to `x`, `fit` to `y` and `supp` to `color`.
  * a `geom_line()` layer to visualise the predicted curves.

```{r plot-1, echo=TRUE}
# fit curves by supp
p1.0 <- ggplot(newdata, aes(x=dose, y=fit, color=supp)) +
  geom_line()
p1.0
```

### Add confidence bands with geom_ribbon()

Next we add layer for the confidence bands.

`geom_ribbon()` requires the aesthetics `ymax` and `ymin`, which we map to `upr` and `lwr`, respectively.
We specify that fill colours of the ribbons are mapped to `supp` as well (otherwise they will be filled black).

```{r plot-2, echo=TRUE}
# add confidence bands
p1.1 <- p1.0 + geom_ribbon(aes(ymax=upr, ymin=lwr, fill=supp))
p1.1
```

The fill colour has obscured everything.
We set (outside of `aes()`) the alpha (transparency) level of `geom_ribbon()` to a constant of 1/5.

```{r plot-3, echo=TRUE}
# make confidence bands transparent
# alpha=1/5 means that 5 objects overlaid will be opaque
p1.2 <- p1.0 + geom_ribbon(aes(ymax=upr, ymin=lwr, fill=supp), 
                           alpha=1/5)
p1.2
```

### Adding original data (in a different dataset) to the graph

As a final layer to the graph,
we decide to overlay a scatter plot of the original data,
which is located in our original dataset, `ToothGrowth`.
Fortunately, you can change the dataset in a _ggplot2_ plot.

In `geom_point()` we respecify the data to be `ToothGrowth` to override `newdata`,
and respecify the `y` aesthetic to `len` to override `fit`.
These values would have been inherited from the first `aes()`.

```{r plot-4, echo=TRUE}
# overlay observed data, changing dataset and y aesthetic to observed outcome
p1.3 <- p1.2 +
  geom_point(data=ToothGrowth, aes(y=len))
p1.3
```

### Finishing the graph: adjusting theme and theme elements

Finally, we make a few non-data related changes to the graph.

The _ggplot2_ package provides a few built-in themes
(see [the `ggtheme()` reference page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) for a full list),
which make several changes to the overall background look of the graphic.

First we change the overall look of a graph with such a built-in theme, `theme_classic()`,
which replaces the gray background and white gridlines with a white background,
no grid lines, no border on the top or right. 
This theme mimics the look of base R graphics.

```{r plot-5, echo=TRUE}
# overlay observed data
p1.4 <- p1.3 + theme_classic()
p1.4
```

Next we change the colour of the `OJ` group to a more obvious orange.

`scale_fill_manual()` and `scale_color_manual()` allow colour specification through hexadecimal notation
(often called colour hex codes, `#` followed by 6 alphanumeric characters).

On the [Color Brewer website](http://colorbrewer2.org/),
are many ready-to-use colour scales with corresponding colour hex codes.
We find a qualitative scale we like (the '3-class Set2' set)
with an orange, hex code `#fc8d62`, and a complementary green, hex code `#66c2a5`.

We apply these orange-green colours scales to both the `color` aesthetic
(colour of points, fit line and the borders of ribbon),
and to the fill aesthetic (fill colour of the confidence bands)

```{r plot-6, echo=TRUE}
# specify hex codes for orange, #fc8d62, and green #66c2a5
p1.5 <- p1.4 + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#fc8d62", "#66c2a5")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#fc8d62", "#66c2a5"))
p1.5
```

Finally, we use `labs()` to make the axes and guide titles more descriptive.
(The `"\n"` is a newline.)
We also move the _guide_ (legend) to the bottom with `theme()`.

```{r plot-7, echo=TRUE}
# note the default text justifications for the x-axis vs guide
p1.6 <- p1.5 + labs(x="dosage vitamin C\n(mg/day)", 
                    y="tooth length", fill="supplement\ntype",
                    color ="supplement\ntype") +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
p1.6
```

We've built this up piece-by-piece.
Here is the full code for the plot.
Run it to confirm this is the case.

```{r plotfinalsetup}

ToothGrowth$dosesq <- ToothGrowth$dose ^ 2
model_quad <- lm(len ~ (dose + dosesq)*supp, data=ToothGrowth)

newdata <- data.frame(dose=rep(seq(0.5, 2, .01),each=2), 
                      supp=factor(c("OJ", "VC")))
newdata$dosesq <- newdata$dose ^ 2
newdata <- data.frame(newdata,
                      predict(model_quad, newdata, interval="confidence"))
```

```{r plot-final, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="plotfinalsetup"}
ggplot(newdata, aes(x=dose, y=fit, color=supp)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymax=upr, ymin=lwr, fill=supp), alpha=1/5) +
  geom_point(data=ToothGrowth, aes(x=dose, y=len)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#fc8d62", "#66c2a5")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#fc8d62", "#66c2a5")) +
  labs(x="dosage vitamin C\n(mg/day)", y="tooth length", 
       fill="supplement\ntype",
       color ="supplement\ntype") +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

### Recap

  * Build graphs layer-by-layer
  * Use exploratory graphs to characterise the sample and to inspect relationships between model variables
  * The `stat_summary()` function greatly simplifies plotting means and other summaries
  * You can change global aesthetics using `aes()` outside of any layer
  * Assess model assumptions with diagnostic plots.
  * You can plot from multiple datasets on the same graph
  * Use built-in _themes_ to change the overall look of a graph
