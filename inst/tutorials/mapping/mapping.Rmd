## Overview

This tutorial discusses how to use leaflet in a Shiny application.

<span class="copyright">© Copyright 2018, 2021, 2022 UNSW Sydney. All rights reserved except where otherwise stated.</span>

## Introduction

We are going to look at a very basic interactive map-based application using shiny and leaflet.

To begin with we'll just display a single polygon and give some control over it using a shiny input.

A leaflet/shiny application is just like any other shiny application:

 * the user changes some inputs
 * the server back-end recalculates some outputs
 * the UI displays the changed outputs
 
we're just doing it with maps as well. &#x1F601;

## Shiny-related leaflet functions

The _leaflet_ package gives us some functions to integrate with Shiny:

 * `renderLeaflet` — on the server side
 * `leafletOutput` — on the UI side

You should recognise these as being analogous to `renderPlot` and `plotOutput` for displaying plots in a Shiny application.

In addition to these functions, existing Shiny functions are useful with _leaflet_,
for example `actionButton` can be useful to trigger a calculation or update.

## A basic application

Let's construct a basic application which will display a polygon.
We won't concern ourselves with Shiny interactivity at first.
Note, however, some interactively is already built into a _leaflet_ output element
such as the ability to move the map around and zoom in and out.
We do not need to do anything extra in our Shiny application to enable this.

Let's construct a server which will simply return a _leaflet_ map with a single polygon highlighted.
We'll select one of the 2016 Commonwealth Electoral Districts and use its boundary.

Notice that because these boundaries never change or move over the lifetime of our application running,
we do this once only outside the server function.
We certainly don't want to do it inside the closure for `output$basic.map` because that would mean
every time the map output changed as a result of changed input,
_all_ the data files would get reloaded.
Besides introducing unnecessary computation into our application,
since they're quite large that would take a while and it would introduce a long delay into the response time
and decrease the interactivity of our application.

<div class="under-the-bonnet">
### Under the bonnet...

It's important to put code like this in the right place.
In the Shiny server architecture there are three places where it can be placed
and it will be run at different times over the lifetime of the application:

```
# outside the server function

server <- function(input, output) {

  # inside the server function but outside a closure for any specific output
  
  output$map <- renderLeaflet({
    # inside the closure calculating the value of an output
  })
}
```

Code outside the server function is run once when the server back-end is started with `runApp()`. Code here is run _once per application._

Code inside the server function but outside a closure for any specific output is run when a user visits the app for the first time. Code here is run _once for each user._

Code inside output closures is run every time an output is recalculated. Code here is run _once per change, possibly even many times a second._

It pays to think about where to put code and how often it needs to be executed.
</div>

The census data files have an id column `CED_CODE_2016` of the form `CEDxxx` where `xxx` is a numeric id.
The shape data has an id column `CED_CODE16` of the form `xxx`, _i.e._ without the `CED` prefix.

We need to take this into account when selecting by id.
The easiest thing to do is to add a `CED_CODE_2016` column to the shape data.

Here is our server code:

```
my.package <- packageName()

# a utility function for calculating filenames included with our tutorial package
packageFile <- function(filename) {
  # look for filename in the extdata directory of our package 
  system.file("extdata", filename, package=my.package)
}

# read in the CED info data
CED_info_file <- packageFile("CED_2016_AUST.csv")
CED_info <- read.csv(CED_info_file)
CED_info <- CED_info %>%
  mutate(CED_CODE_2016 = paste0("CED", CED_info$CED_CODE_2016))

# read in the CED polygons and add CED code column
CED_polys_file <- packageFile("CED_2016_AUST.shp")
CED_polys <- rgdal::readOGR(CED_polys_file)
CED_polys$CED_CODE_2016 <- paste0("CED", CED_polys$CED_CODE16)

# just select one polygon with id CED101 (Banks)

CED_poly <- CED_polys[CED_polys$CED_CODE_2016 == "CED101"]

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$basic.map <- renderLeaflet({
    m <- leaflet() %>%
            addTiles() %>%
            addPolygons(data=CED_poly)
    m
  })
}
```
```{r basic.map-setup, context="setup"}
# a utility function for calculating filenames included with our tutorial package
packageFile <- function(filename) {
  # look for filename in the extdata directory of our package 
  system.file("extdata", filename, package=my.package)
}

# read in the CED info data
CED_info_file <- packageFile("CED_2016_AUST.csv")
CED_info <- read.csv(CED_info_file)
CED_info <- CED_info %>%
  mutate(CED_CODE_2016 = paste0("CED", CED_info$CED_CODE_2016))

# read in the CED polygons and add CED code column
CED_polys_file <- packageFile("CED_2016_AUST.shp")
CED_polys <- rgdal::readOGR(CED_polys_file)
CED_polys$CED_CODE_2016 <- factor(paste0("CED", CED_polys$CED_CODE16))

# just select one polygon with id CED101 (Banks)

CED_poly <- CED_polys[CED_polys$CED_CODE_2016 == "CED101",]
```
```{r basic.map-server, context="server"}
output$basic.map <- renderLeaflet({
  m <- leaflet() %>%
          addTiles() %>%
          addPolygons(data=CED_poly)
  m
})
```

We've taken the approach here of constructing our leaflet map object and assigning it to `m` and returning `m`
(rather than just doing it all in one step)
because later we'll see that it gives us the chance to do extra things with `m` before returning it
such as responding to different inputs!

Here is our UI code:

<div class="bordered-container-fluid">
```{r basic-map-ui, echo=TRUE}
fluidPage(
  leafletOutput("basic.map")
)
```
</div>

We have added no addition Shiny input widgets but leaflet provides its own controls for zooming and panning.
(Leaflet does provide ways to detect if the user zooms or pans the map but we won't be using them here.)

## Refining the application

Let's refine our application: let's add a control to change the colour of the polygon.

<div class="under-the-bonnet">
### Under the bonnet..

Notice that we've change the name of the application inputs and outputs.
This is because all of these examples are actually running as part of a single shiny application (this _learnr_ tutorial!)
and so we need to keep all of these examples separate.

It's always a good idea to give things descriptive names anyway rather than just `my_map` and `colour`.
</div>

We need an input to select the colour and we need to change the output closure to use it.

We won't bother reloading the data files here because we've already done it once _outside_ our server function definition
and so we don't need to do it again. They haven't changed.

Here is our server code:
```
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$responsive.map <- renderLeaflet({
    m <- leaflet() %>%
            addTiles() %>%
            addPolygons(data=CED_poly,
                        weight=2,
                        color=input$responsive.map.colour)
    m
  })
}
```
```{r responsive.map-server, context="server"}
output$responsive.map <- renderLeaflet({
  m <- leaflet() %>%
          addTiles() %>%
          addPolygons(data=CED_poly,
                      weight=2,
                      color=input$responsive.map.colour)
  m
})
```

And here are the UI elements:

<div class="bordered-container-fluid">
```{r responsive.map-ui, echo=TRUE}
colours <- c("Blue"="blue", "Red"="red", "Yellow"="yellow", "Green"="green")
fluidPage(
  leafletOutput("responsive.map"),
  selectInput("responsive.map.colour", label="Polygon colour:", choices=colours, selected=colours[0])
)
```
</div>

Notice how the entire map is redrawn when the input changes.
This is because a completely new leaflet map object is created when the input changes.
It's functional but we'll see how to remove this flicker later and make our application snappier in the process.

## Conditional map processing

Let's add markers for the railway stations.
We'll add a check-box to show/hide the markers and introduce some conditional code in the output closure.

Here is our server code. Notice how we have taken advantage of the map being in `m` to conditionally add markers.

```
# read in our station data (names, latitudes and longitudes)
stations_data_file <- packageFile("stations_data.csv")
stations_data <- read.csv(stations_data_file)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$conditional.map <- renderLeaflet({
    m <- leaflet() %>%
            addTiles() %>%
            addPolygons(data=CED_poly,
                        weight=2,
                        color=input$conditional.map.colour)
    if (input$conditional.map.markers) {
      m <- m %>% addMarkers(data=stations_data)
    }
    m
  })
}
```
```{r conditional.map-setup, context="setup"}
# read in our station data (names, latitudes and longitudes)
stations_data_file <- packageFile("stations_data.csv")
stations_data <- read.csv(stations_data_file)
```
```{r conditional.map-server, context="server"}
output$conditional.map <- renderLeaflet({
  m <- leaflet() %>%
          addTiles() %>%
          addPolygons(data=CED_poly,
                      weight=2,
                      color=input$conditional.map.colour)
  if (input$conditional.map.markers) {
    m <- m %>% addMarkers(data=stations_data)
  }
  m
})
```

And here are the UI elements:

<div class="bordered-container-fluid">
```{r conditional.map-ui, echo=TRUE}
colours <- c("Blue"="blue", "Red"="red", "Yellow"="yellow", "Green"="green")
fluidPage(
  leafletOutput("conditional.map"),
  selectInput("conditional.map.colour", label="Polygon colour:", choices=colours, selected=colours[0]),
  checkboxInput("conditional.map.markers", label="Show stations")
)
```
</div>

## Map proxies

So far we have regenerated the map when inputs change.
While this generates the correct output it's not very aesthetic (it flickers)
or efficient (it involves a lot of extra unnecessary work).

Leaflet provides a `leafletProxy` function which _updates_ an existing map without redrawing everything.

With this approach, we create the map once and update using a `leafletProxy()` object when things change.

Notice we create `the.map` once in a default configuration (we know because of the way we have set up the UI
that it will start with a blue polygon and no markers).

The `observe()` function takes a closure which will get run when one of its dependencies (inputs) changes.
It's just like an output closure except its result isn't used.
It's only run for its side-effects, in this case, updating the map.

```
the.map <- leaflet() %>%
              addTiles() %>%
              addPolygons(data=CED_poly,
                          weight=2,
                          color="blue",
                          group="CEDs")

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$efficient.map <- renderLeaflet({the.map})
  
  # whenever the efficient.map.markers input changes, update the markers
  observe({
    if (input$efficient.map.markers) {
      leafletProxy("efficient.map") %>% addMarkers(data=stations_data, group="stations")
    } else {
      leafletProxy("efficient.map") %>% clearGroup("stations")  
    }
  })
  
  # whenever the input$efficient.map.colour changes, update the polygon
  observe({
    leafletProxy("efficient.map") %>%
      clearGroup("CEDs") %>%
      addPolygons(data=CED_poly,
                  weight=2,
                  color=input$efficient.map.colour,
                  group="CEDs")
  })
}
```
```{r efficient.map-setup, context="setup"}
efficient.map <- leaflet() %>%
                    addTiles() %>%
                    addPolygons(data=CED_poly,
                                weight=2,
                                color="blue",
                                group="CEDs")
```
```{r efficient.map-server, context="server"}
output$efficient.map <- renderLeaflet({efficient.map})

observe({
  if (input$efficient.map.markers) {
    leafletProxy("efficient.map") %>% addMarkers(data=stations_data, group="stations")
  } else {
    leafletProxy("efficient.map") %>% clearGroup("stations")  
  }
})

observe({
  leafletProxy("efficient.map") %>%
    clearGroup("CEDs") %>%
    addPolygons(data=CED_poly,
                weight=2,
                color=input$efficient.map.colour,
                group="CEDs")
})
```

And here are the UI elements:

<div class="bordered-container-fluid">
```{r efficient.map-ui, echo=TRUE}
colours <- c("Blue"="blue", "Red"="red", "Yellow"="yellow", "Green"="green")
fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Example using leafletProxy"),
  sidebarPanel(
    selectInput("efficient.map.colour", label="Polygon colour:", choices=colours, selected=colours[0]),
    checkboxInput("efficient.map.markers", label="Show stations")
  ),
  mainPanel(
    leafletOutput("efficient.map")
  )
)
```
</div>

## More interesting maps

Finally, lets look an an example of a map which visualises something interesting about a few electorates.
We'll select a group of electorates (around the one we've already been looking at)
and colour them according to various aspects of median weekly rent:

 * by absolute value
 * by different from the national median

Information here can be downloaded from the 
[Census Data Packs page](https://datapacks.censusdata.abs.gov.au/datapacks/)
on the ABS website.

```

And our UI:

<div class="bordered-container-fluid">
```{r visualisation.map-ui, echo=TRUE}
colours <- c("Blue"="blue", "Red"="red", "Yellow"="yellow", "Green"="green")
fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Example visualisation of "),
  sidebarPanel(
    radioButtons("visualisation.map.colour.type", "Map type",
                 choices = c("Median weekly rent"="absolute",
                             "Difference from national median"="difference"))
  ),
  mainPanel(
    leafletOutput("visualisation.map")
  )
)
```
</div>

<div class="aside">
### Aside...

Leaflet will also let us put controls on a map to control things like the visibility of groups and layers
so we don't have to do so much work.

Under that approach we add everything to the map but set some things to be hidden
and then show/hide things selectively.

This concludes our tutorial on interactive mapping with shiny and leaflet.
